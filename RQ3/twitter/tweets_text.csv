142,nethermindeth,3,@GuthL @Bloxy_info Only the last comment at that link is valid and the discussion here brings much more details about what actually is happening. A miner cannot mine a new block without verifying the parent because they will not be able to create a valid state root and they need it before hashing.,Thu Sep 26 16:47:19 +0000 2019
142,nethermindeth,3,"@GuthL @Bloxy_info Longer block propagation due to bigger block sizes (more txs included) might be an important factor.

142,nethermindeth,3,@SchalkDormehl @3esmit finally you have every single state entry starting from the state root of any of the last 32 blocks with their hashes recalculated so the trie is fully verified.

539,commonsstack,7,"5/ So...what is #ConvictionVoting? It's a new decision making process where voters can continuously express their preference by staking tokens in support of proposals they like. You could consider it kind of like ""vote streaming"". https://t.co/AYT4UPf3yk",Thu Sep 24 19:23:12 +0000 2020

539,commonsstack,7,"1/ The results are in! Our first Conviction Voting pilot is awarding the Top 15 projects - as voted on by our community - with ~89x grant matching from @PanvalaHQ

539,commonsstack,7,"12/ A. Conviction Funding: Proposals have a discrete 'passing' threshold. When group conviction exceeds the threshold, funds are disbursed. Examples include the @1Hiveorg or @CommonsStack patterns, which are distributed work proposal systems that allocate DAO funds. https://t.co/wjFiLzzrTt",Thu Sep 24 19:23:19 +0000 2020
539,commonsstack,7,"@1Hiveorg was first to deploy Conviction Voting, a new vote-streaming governance tool, on @xDAIchain.

@lkngtn @jessicazartler walk through the 1Hive Conviction Voting Dapp and discuss how these tools can improve on-chain governance.

539,commonsstack,7,"4/ New voting tools, enabled by blockchain technology, can provide communities with rich data streams of continuous preference signals from their members, rather than getting a mere ""snapshot"" of their opinions through a regular time-boxed voting process. https://t.co/eWpM0x641B",Thu Sep 24 19:23:11 +0000 2020

539,commonsstack,7,15/ Why Model CV in @cadCAD_org? Because digital twins help us understand and manage complex systems. Think of them like digital flight simulators. They can be used to run your system through many different “scenarios” to see what effects may throw your system out of balance. https://t.co/KG7fJwnOQf,Thu Sep 24 19:23:23 +0000 2020
539,commonsstack,7,"13/ B. Conviction Consensus: Proposals are continuous, reflecting a ‘dynamic average consensus' of the group. An example could be a community parameter (such as an exit tax rate) that is dynamically set based on the averaged continual input of members. https://t.co/8zhlZsDAu5",Thu Sep 24 19:23:20 +0000 2020

✔️ Distributed decision making
✔️ Turning evolving social needs into coordinated action
✔️ Insight into collective community intent",Thu Sep 24 19:23:13 +0000 2020
539,commonsstack,7,"6/ This allows people to weigh-in anytime &amp; eliminates the need for group consensus on every proposal.

3600,0xUnicast,11,"Why?
The current generation of DeFi protocols has brought unprecedented levels of programmability and automation. 

We believe the next wave will focus on intelligence as a core capability. 

This is a perfect challenge for the Scaleout team!",Wed Sep 15 13:01:57 +0000 2021
3600,0xUnicast,11,"What?
The goal of the UniCast project is to publish a v1 of a model that predicts volatility in Uniswap v3 trading pairs. 

This can be used to find the Uniswap v3 LP ranges that maximises fees, and thereby makes Uniswap v3 LPing incredibly more capital efficient.",Wed Sep 15 13:01:55 +0000 2021
