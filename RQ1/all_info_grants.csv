1244,a-way-for-the-masses-to-passively-acquire-the-top,"New cryptocurrency users face product complexity which helped inspire the idea for e20.io which has the goal of enabling anyone to swap ETH for the top 20 most valuable 20 ERC20 tokens in one click. 

I will use the proceeds from this grant to posts bounties on Gitcoin, to help build the next pieces to the puzzle needed to achieve the above vision, as the current iteration requires manually configuring and placing each order via Uniswap widgets. 

We will have custom token lists that update as the top 20 rankings change, and may exclude certain stable coins from the rankings, such as Tether and USDC due to their reserves managed by classical corporations. 

In addition, there are currently three models of weightings for asset allocations that I have, so that users can choose and receive a market-weighted distribution (i.e. the largest position will be in the top ranking asset, while the smallest allocation will be the lowest ranking asset, based on Etherscan data, or a combination of Bitwise index reference data).

670,geoma-dao,"Greetings ! 

 

We are more than happy to announce our first Gitcoin Grand Application !



Let's learn what Geoma DAO represents:



The main idea is very simple: a mutual fund ,managed by the power of a DAO, which creates/invests in different Web-based project/Real-World Projects.



 We will keep this simple, pragmatic and to the point. Blockchain Technology was designed to be disruptive. Disruption comes from decentralisation and autonomy. The DAO or the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, as a structure, was born the same day Blockchain Technology was revealed to the public.



It is, in our opinion, the most advanced model of worldwide human collaboration to date. It is indeed THE NEW ECONOMIC MODEL FOR THE 21 CENTURY.



The potential of a DAO is enormous and has still to be explored. It is given by the Intelligence, the Know-How and the high Moral Standards of its contributors. The contributors can make progressive proposals within the DAO targeting

innovative technologies from different sectors like Energy, Farming, Healthcare,Education, Insurance just to mention some examples.



 The performance of the DAO increases manyfold if it can operate in the physical world.And exactly this is what the GEOMA DAO will achieve:Create CASHFLOW AND WEALTH FOR IT'S CONTRIBUTORS

Authors use pulp to publish blog content and manage subscribers.

About:
The application is decentralized: it uses private keys for identity, the Ethereum network for business logic, and IPFS/Filecoin for persistence.
The result is that authors are not locked into any one client: the publishing platform is commoditized (as a rich protocol) and the Author retains control over their relationship with the Subscriber.
pulp was a HackFS finalist project; you can see our finalist demo here: https://youtu.be/GibA0t0z_9w?t=1046 (at 17:26)

401,solui-generate-dapps-for-smart-contracts,"""Generate Dapps for smart contracts""

solUI is an open source tool that lets you generate Dapps for your smart contracts without needing to know frontend coding. 

Developers can build their Dapp locally (by writing a JSON template) alongside their contracts (and comes with browser hot-reloading built-in!). Once it's ready they can publish it straight to IPFS so that it's always available.

Everything is handled through the command-line client, installed via NPM - @solui/cli.

It's perfect for quickly creating and publishing Dapps for e.g. admin use, hackathons, etc. The UI template operates at a higher level than the contract ABI so the UI can be more intelligent (e.g. checking whether input addresses are contracts or not) and powerful (e.g. you can chain method calls across multiple contracts together in one execution).

Every solUI Dapp is shareable and embeddable in another page and the styling can be customized on a per-instance basis. solUI itself is packaged in a modular way so you can use the UI parser programmatically (think ""headless testing"")

It's already in production use and was used to build the ETHLDN 2020 winning entry -> https://devpost.com/software/zksocialrecovery :)

I want solUI to evolve into a commonly-used tool such that in future the majority of on-chain contracts get deployed along with user-friendly Dapps hosted on IPFS. It would be cool to be able to enter just a contract address (no ABI needed) into something like Etherscan and immediately get a nice UI for the contract (there is already an on-chain contract to faciliate this!).

4293,refi-spring-2022-event-series,"What is ReFi Spring? 🤔
We are curating a collection of in-person events in differing locations next year that cover various formats and perspectives. We are raising awareness about the regenerative finance movement to a range of actors:

Climate activists
Land stewards
Regulators and local governments
Entrepreneurs
Investors
Developers & Designers

Why are we submitting a grant application? ☀️
We want to raise funds in order to support local event organizers to host meaningful conversations about the ReFi movement and tailor content to their specific context.

Our objectives 🎯
These events aim to address a handful of core problems facing the industry:

Most people mistakenly believe crypto is bad for the planet and therefore don’t engage
Regulators don’t understand the power of crypto to address the most pressing challenges of our time
Creating meaningful connections is much easier in-person than online
Climate sensitive folks do not like to travel by plane too much

The team 🙌
We’re a growing group of organizers moving forward ReFi Spring 2022:

Felix Fritsch & Giulio Quarta from Crypto Commons Association
Jakub Lanc from FreeCircle
Luuk Weber from Kolektivo
Eugenio Battaglia 
Sam Delesque from Closer.earth + re-encrypt.co + Traditional Dream Factory + re-build.co
John Ellison from Toucan Protocol and KlimaDAO
Hereward McGillivray from climate2025
Damiano Avellino from Platform Design Toolkit
Robert Heilberg from dClimate and Arbol

Our work 📖
We are creating an open source ReFi conference framework that makes it easy for local event organizers to schedule and facilitate a meaningful in-person event in their community.

Alongside the framework we’re also hosting weekly calls to coordinate and onboard various events to ReFi Spring.

The idea is that by creating an open source framework and coordinating body we can enable a decentralized network of local events to create unique experiences tailored to their local context.

Rather than have one mega conference with significant embodied carbon from air travel, we want to encourage people to attend the event nearest them and avoid the most carbon intensive forms of transport.
 
The framework 🧮
The event framework provides resources that support conferences of varying sizes from:

Casual meetup: 10 – 30 people
Small conference: 30 - 70 people
Medium conference: 70 – 200 people
Large conference: 200 - 500 people
Massive conference: 500+

Why small, local events matter 🎤
Given each local context as a different sample of local actors, we’ll reach a much more diverse audience by having a variety of local events as opposed to a single major conference in a major city.

We have confirmed events of varying sizes in the following locations:

Amsterdam led by Luuk from Kolektivo (1 day, 150-300 participants)
Austrian Alps led by Felix and Guilio from Crypto Commons Association (7 days, 60 participants)
Prague led by Jakub from FreeCircle (1 day, 100 participants)
London led by John from Toucan and KlimaDAO (2 days, 150 participants)
Vienna led by Felix from Crypto Commons Association in cooperation with Jakob Hackel from Economics University Vienna (2 days, 150 participants)
NYC led by Robert of dClimate
Re:encrypt in Abela, Alentejo led by Eugenio from Traditional Dream Factory (3 days, 40 participants mix IRL and online)
Bologna led by Damiano Dada from Platform Design Toolkit and Hereward McGillivray from climate2025 (1 day, part of a 1 month academy by Avanguardie Cooperative)
More events are coming soon! See http://refispring.com/ for updates

We're pursuing other funding sources 💸
We applied for grant funding from Regen Network on Nov 30 and are planning to apply for additional funding to the Ethereum Foundation as well as to KlimaDAO, IXO Foundation and other value-aligned projects. 

We have not received any funding to date.

Our budget

$15,000 to enable the local events to make deposits and book venues 
$15,000 to market local events and promote ticket sales
$10,000 in ticket subsidies for land stewards and indigenous people
$5,000 to create the ReFi Event Framework
$5,000 to create the ReFi Spring 2022 website

Avrit is a decentralized education system to be built on the top blockchain that evaluates evidence of learning and quality of curriculum; provides a collaboration platform for teachers, students, researchers, and rentable educational resource providers. It relies on game-theoretic incentive systems where participants earn for the quality contribution they make to the platform.

 I tell my students, 'When you get these jobs that you have been so brilliantly trained for, just remember that your real job is that if you are free, you need to free somebody else. If you have some power, then your job is to empower somebody else. This is not just a grab-bag candy game.
 -- Toni Morrison

Education is a process of acquiring knowledge; developing reasoning skills for making good judgments; and acquisition of necessary skills, values, beliefs, and habits. The current education system faces serious problems of quality, resource crunch and educational malpractices which includes obsolete teaching, substandard centralized curriculum and learning material, high-stake standardized exams that limit exploration and original thinking, mass cheating in exams and projects, appalling teacher and student ratio, poor classroom infrastructure, and non-availability of classrooms and specialized courses nearby students residence.

How avrit learning solves our education puzzle?

Girls education

According to UNICEF:

When we invest in girls’ secondary education
The lifetime earnings of girls dramatically increase
National growth rates rise
Child marriage rates decline
Child mortality rates fall
Maternal mortality rates fall
Child stunting drops
Poor families have more willingness to invest in boys education rather than girls education because girls can’t contribute to parents family earnings, as they will get married and move to their husbands home.  

Bullying

In India, the concern is not just about bullying by classmates or seniors, but sometimes teachers act like a bully. Sometimes teacher goes to extreme steps like hanging the student upside down from the building as a form of punishment. Children can suffer emotionally due to the power game of the management and teacher.

Emotional Intelligence

Metal health has become a pandemic. Children with high emotional intelligence reduce stress, take responsibility for their actions, treat friends and family members with empathy and compassion.  

Poverty

Education develops skills and abilities to earn a living. Not everyone who is uneducated is in extreme poverty, but those living in extreme poverty do lack basic education. 

Biases and stereotypes

For example, Girls are good at biology and boys are good at maths. We always have a tendency or prejudice toward or against something or someone. With proper scientific education, we can make better decisions and fall less towards biases. 

Reservation

Our education system is designed as a scarce resource. Quality education doesn’t scale, as a result, we have limited seats, which leads to the reservation for lower caste to give them a chance for upliftment. 

Costly education

Higher education is costly, many go to higher education by taking loans or quit from their education as they can’t afford it. 

Grades

Though competition keeps our focus on our goal, many times it turns toxic for grades that leads to “teaching to test” type of education. Thousands of students end their lives every year in India due to the toxic competition culture. 

Outdated syllabus

Due to the centralized and bureaucratic nature of education, it’s so difficult to update the curriculum as no one is accountable for it and the curriculum is not updated for many decades. 

Unemployment

We have an education where 80% of engineers are unemployable in India. They lack the knowledge of new-edge technology that is needed for jobs.

Child Labour

A total of 152 million children – 64 million girls and 88 million boys – are estimated to be in child labour globally, accounting for almost one in ten of all children worldwide. In India Census 2011, the total child population in India in the age group (5-14) years is 259.6 million. Of these, 10.1 million (3.9% of total child population) are working, either as ‘main worker’ or as ‘marginal worker’.
We can eliminate child labor providing income for learning.

So, how does Avrit solve these problems?

https://avrit.reaudito.com

A decentralized platform for earning by designing and reviewing the study material or content, assignments, projects, practicals, and assessments.

Avrit has evidence of learning as explainer videos. Instead of the teacher, the student will explain. The explainer script can be prepared by the teacher with the student’s collaboration. Explainer script must meet the review guidelines and can be in both English and the native language, making sure the student has understood whatever they are saying. As students do the work, they participate in active learning and there is an increase in engagement. Making explainer videos has so many benefits, it works on multiple skills like critical thinking, improving their vocabulary, communication skills, and comprehension.

Making explainer videos can be hectic for both teachers and students because it causes repetition of work and slows down the process. But repetition and slowing down causes brain to exercise which is key to comprehension and learning. Students engage actively rather than becoming passive listeners of lecture and don’t get bored by learning.

Evidence of learning is not limited to explainer videos, it can be anything like practice assignments, real-world projects, or volunteering work like making the neighborhood garbage free.

All are validated by Schelling game, so there is minimal chance of corruption.

It’s based on the competition collaboration algorithm:

https://technoperiod.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-competitive-collaboration-algorithm.html

When you upload your evidence of learning based on meeting the guidelines of avrit learning by staking, and no one challenges it, you earn 1 AVRIT token. 

The apps like proof of humanity have proved that you can earn passive income just by validating that you are a real human.

Here, in Avrit learning, your evidence of learning is validated and you earn an income. 

As it’s decentralized in nature and you earn for learning, girls’ education will not be a problem. It will be run by the local community with few students in a group, so chances of bullying are rare. The curriculum will be up to date due to the evidence-based learning strategy guidelines and due to the competition collaboration algorithm. Here teachers have the responsibility to update the curriculum by learning from other teachers rather than any central bureaucratic authority. We can also have teachers’ governance that will provide recommendations for curriculum, learning content, and best practices. 

Quality education is no more a scarce resource and is scalable, so reservation is unnecessary, students are evaluated by evidence of learning, which also makes grades unnecessary. 

It’s all open-source, and as it’s on the blockchain, it’s not owned by anybody, so no predatory practices by some private ed-tech company. 




A Use Case:

 Vidya is a student with age 13 from India. She is not good at mathematics. School she is studying provide her little support to improve her mathematics, as the teacher in the school can't give her the special time she requires due to large classroom size. Neither she understands anything the teacher teaches in the classroom. While searching the internet she reads a blog about Avrit, and registers into the platform. There she finds many teachers near her location willing to offer the course to improve mathematics. But she had doubts about whether she can really improve her mathematics. So, she analyzed the functioning of the Avrit education platform. She found that the curriculum is rigorously tested and peer-reviewed by the researchers and cognitive scientists using principles of learning strategy and its importance and relevance in the complex, ever-evolving world. She can directly pay to the teacher without any intermediary, but money will remain in escrow and will be released to the teacher only after Vidya submits her evidence of learning and the evidence evaluated by other teachers and researchers of the specialization. 

Arya is a math teacher joined Avrit in search of a job. After joining he could find the best learning materials recommended by other teachers and researchers, also he could find rented educational resources like books, project kits to teach students, and decent classrooms to teach where students can join. When the teaching of Arya is not up to the mark, he receives feedback and constructive criticism from other researchers and teachers. This keeps him accountable to maintain quality in teaching, and also helps him to improve his teaching with time. He also learned how to use programming in solving mathematical problems. Arya receives direct payments from students, without any intermediary schools owners. 

 Divya discovered Arya in the Avrit, and made him as her math teacher. Every month Divya earns some tokens which she can exchange to buy things when she submits her evidence of learning and is approved. Parents can also check the feedback of teachers and researchers about how Divya is doing in her studies. Divya not only learned mathematics but also started solving mathematical problems with programming. She also made new friends in her new classroom and started collaborating with them to do math projects. She no more fears math and started loving mathematics.

The Platform: Launchpad for Web3 Publishing
The Platform heralds a new era for publishing. As a DAO developing open-source tech, we create Web 3.0 publishing tools for artists and creators. 

While The Platform will host its own and selected publications, magazines, catalogues and art, we also intend to make our open source technology and templates freely available to the world this year. 
	
Funding delays have in turn delayed our expected launch, but we’ve continued building and pushing forward as a DAO and will be launching in a few weeks.

What we are seeking funds for in Gitcoin Grants Round 14

Donations from the Gitcoin community will go towards developing and documenting open source tools plus supporting our running costs plus putting The Platform live. Below are some details:

Launch Publication: The First Novel as Integrated NFT






The Platform will shortly launch with its debut publication – a Spanish-language novel by DADA.art cofounder Yehudit Mam, with cover design by Moxarra González. Quién te manda is the first readable book NFT, created by The Platform DAO members Álvaro Recuenco and Ismael Gómez García of the independent publisher Editorial Ferragosto.

We believe The Platform is releasing the first NFT book in the truest sense. To date, most projects claiming to be “NFT books” are really just PDFs attached to tokens. In contrast, the entire interactive content of Quién te manda is the content of the NFT, offering an immersive, interactive, and potentially nonlinear experience. With our first publication, we are showing how books can be designed, experienced and collected in digitally native ways. 
	
For more context on NFTs and publishing, please read Mam's landmark article ""NFTs and the Rebirth of the Reader"" (Right Click Save, May 2022). 

Second Publication: A Magazine
Following release of the novel The Platform will launch Headroom, a publication reimagining art on the edges of a new digital culture. Featured artists' works integrated with contextual articles will be collectible as NFTs from within the publication itself (NFT magazine as marketplace). As with the book, Headroom will be freely available to read and experience in a mobile-first format.


Design in progress for Headroom, one of The Platform's in-house publications, focused on cryptoart.


Developing Open Source
We are providing open source tools – smart contracts, API, and front end templates – that will enable anyone to create their own independent Web3 publication, powered by The Platform. The funds we receive during this Gitcoin round will be allocated to developing and documenting these tools. 

We believe in inclusivity and diversity, so we’re making Web3 publishing simple and available to all by reducing technical knowledge requirements (and costs) and encouraging open knowledge sharing. Plus, we’ll be able to gather feedback and harness input from the open source community to continue optimising The Platform itself. These funds will also be applied to the ongoing costs of hosting The Platform and running a Palm validator node (roughly USD500 per month).	
	
The Platform is running a transaction validator node on the Palm blockchain. We decided to do this to show our support of, belief in, and commitment to Palm’s ecosystem. Their mission, like ours, is to reward both creators and participants, with scalable sustainability at the heart of the vision. By participating in the network in this way, we become the network: in validating new blocks, we are literally co-creating the chain. In the future, this should also earn us enough Palm tokens to pay for deploying publications’ contracts, or minting NFTs.


Recent Update: We Won an Accelerator Slot to Support our Becoming a Co-operative Entity
In addition to being run as a DAO, The Platform is in the process of incorporating as a UK cooperative – a legal entity in which multiple stakeholder groups own and operate a business or organisation. This is an important step forward in legal engineering for DAOs, as most DAOs currently lack legal structure or use a centralised entity such as LLC or Foundation. Co-operatives and DAOs are a natural fit – inherently decentralised, member-owned, open, and equitable.

To help us get there, we are currently taking part in UnFound, a comprehensive 10-week intensive accelerator program for UK-based platform co-ops (member-owned businesses run primarily online). UnFound is proving to be incredibly supportive of our vision. We are proud to be learning and growing there, and excited to integrate into the wider co-operative community. UnFound gives us access to countless resources and facilitates mutual support with other co-ops in a spirit of solidarity. We are grateful to be on this journey.

Join us on July 7th to hear our pitch at UnFound! Cheer us on and help us win prize monies from Co-operative Bank. Audience members vote for the winners out of nine teams.  Details and lineup here.


A Catalyst for the Transformation of Publishing
The Platform is changing how people consider and approach books. The music industry shifted with the invention of long-playing vinyl discs. NFTs paved a new way for visual artists. The same is about to happen for publishing.

We are part of a broader movement to democratise publishing. Tsunami approaching! We hope small publishers will use our tools to fund new projects that were previously unthinkable. The Platform will elevate authors and artists who, in traditional publishing, absurdly often end up being lowest in the value chain. Income streams are automatically distributed via smart contracts, flipping the dynamic between publishers and creators from masters and servants to collaborators working on truly equal footing.

Thank you for reading this far. We hope we have demonstrated that the technology underpinning Web3 – and the NFT as a singular, composable, extensible tool – is just at the beginning. By using this tool creatively we can reframe how people in the creator economy can earn, collaborate, collect and support each other in community, far beyond the more linear iterations we have seen to date. The real impact this can have is truly important. By supporting The Platform, you are helping signal a new paradigm in publishing, and we are proud to invite you to be part of it. 

Thank you for your support.

3073,hodl-protocol,"HODLing is known to be one of the best market strategies in crypto, but really difficult to execute due to the irrationality of human nature. We’re here to help you automate it.

Check out the testnet alpha at https://hodlmybeer.co

In our protocol, users can lock their ERC-20 assets in shared pools until the configurable expiry time. Users can always choose to quit before the expiry with a penalty charged, which encourages staying until the end. The participants remaining in the pool until expiry will get their initial deposit and also their share of collected penalties. Additionally, the pool logic allows a third party to donate the same or a different kind of asset to reward the participants. We believe that with all the customizable features, this platform is not just an automation of a crypto meme but a well-squared piece of “DeFi Lego”. The use cases that follow explain our broader vision.

Community Treasury

A project with a token who wishes to stabilize the token price can provide some extra incentive for the community to HODL their tokens and not sell for a longer period of time. This can also be customized as a “Lock” contract, where quitters lose 100% of their deposits.

Vesting contract

Instead of minting tokens directly to the community, projects can lock them up in a HODL pool and define the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries are able to decide if they want to withdraw early and be penalized, or wait until the expiry to receive the full amount. This is similar to the idea of vesting, but with more customizable features.

Long-term staker reward

Many protocols with tokens provide a staking mechanism for token holders to earn some extra reward, but it’s also common for people to leave the pool once the liquidity mining program is over. With HODL, projects can incentivize long-term stakers by deploying a HODL pool contract on “stake share” tokens, and make sure that only the people who hold until the end get rewarded.

Bootstrap Liquidity by incentivizing long-term LP

This is very similar to the previous use case, but takes advantage of the bonus token donation feature of HODL. It might not be the best idea to incentivize LP token holders with more LP tokens, because the risk that the market makers are taking is huge and hard to offset by merely offering more LP shares. This is when the bonus token donation becomes helpful - it allows pool creators to reward the LP token HODLers with a token different from base pool token. This also solves the problem of needing some on-going liquidity mining programs to keep people in the game.

Other Potential Innovations

HODL protocol has the logic allowing for interoperability with other DeFi protocols. The depositors receive a pool-specific non-transferable ERC-20 “hToken” upon deposit that is burned upon redemption from that pool (e.g., DAI turns into hDAI, WBTC into hWBTC, and so on). This allows them to wrap their hToken into some tradable ERC20 token, add more fun by implementing other sophisticated logic, e.g., making it transferable only until a certain date, and so on. We warmly welcome you to innovate together.

Introduction

'yOur Golden Dream' is a collective’s vision for the S33D ecosystem, initially describing a vision to grow “a distributed seed & story library, while recalibrating the value of seed saving and storytelling”. 

The intention has always been to evolve the medium we shared yOur Golden Dream through. Originally printed and signed by hand on hemp paper, we envisioned a process of metamorphosis, utilising simple cryptographic tools to ratify proposals and amendments as we evolved the dream. 

Adhering to CoGov’s methodology for ‘vulnerably transparency’ Protocol.love,  we formalized The S33D Collective with the drafting and invocation of ‘S33D Collective Formilsation Charter’ This enabled us to begin transcribing our process of co-weaving openly. 


“If you read onwards you become part of this tale” Terence McKenna

This Grant

We are currently completing Version 3.0 of 'yOur Golden Dream'. Including embedding the ‘S33D Collective Formilsation Charter’ and the S33D.Life-Iki (an ecosystem map) as an open-source repository. 

Having authored 'yOur Golden Dream', we continue to breathe life into this living charter, the clear and visible spine of our collective’s emerging governance lattice. This grant is therefore to assist in evolving 'yOur Golden Dream' blooming into a shared reality. Our mission now includes:


NARRATING the Dream of weaving together a distributed seed and story library. 
STEWARDING the Methodology by which people can suggest changes and additions to 'yOur Golden Dream', and the collective’s assets. 
EXPLORING and Prioritising the most sustainable and unique ways to print, present, and sign 'yOur Golden Dream' using both ancient crafts and modern technology. 
SHARING these Open technological templates, across a diversity of mediums. 
CURATING & CREATING the Tools and Stories for the dream to bloom. 


S33D Milestone and Accomplishments

Our dream to build a distributed seed & story library is taking shape. If you are new to S33D please see ‘More on S33D’ below to join the journey and discover how yOur vision is manifesting. 


S33D Dream Printing

We printed the first public version of 'yOur Golden Dream' first titled ‘The Golden Charter’, Q2 2018, and hashed it onto the Bitcoin Blockchain on 5th November 2018, we updated it with a second version 6th November 2019. then the ‘S33D Dream’
This Year we began the grant drafting process while revising and hashed the document on the 7th of each month (see Revisions Index), until we formalised the collective with ‘S33D Collective Formilsation Charter’ and agreed to progress to compiling Version 3 early with the minimum addition of this charter.

More on S33D 

S33D is a marriage between the ancient and modern worlds. A collective weaving the vision for a distributing seed & story library, across a network of community pods and plant hives. We initiate the recalibration of our individual and collective sovereign value systems by matching local & global seed saving communities, whilst providing spaces for heart-centered exchanges of; stories, traditional crafts, and organic seed and produce provenance trails.  

Join us in co-coding the DNA of this living and breathing ‘Ancient sm(art) canvas’, assist the birth with cryptographic precision by…

Mapping 

By hashing and storing seed flows, tree distribution, and harvest cycles across distributed ledgers. 
Offering wider and more transparent access to a diversity of food, medicines, plant-based products, as well as their orbiting data.We seek to map every element of our supply chain, and the systems that service it. 

Feeding

Freedom with Creative consumption.
By revaluing the role biodiversity has to play within both our local and global value flows, S33D begins to unlock the full potential of organic assets whilst protecting the seeds of sovereignty. 
Focusing innovation around local, open-source libraries and gardens, S33D opens up a playground of edible education. Empowering us to see the creation inherent in our consumption, we remember we can feed the future world we wish to live in, while feeding ourselves. 

Securing

Data sovereignty for nature and knowledge. 
The SLN (S33D’s Library Network) is harnessing a growing suit of tools to assist us in reconnecting with our sovereign origins through education, trade, and localised community curation.

“Diversity goes hand in with decentralisation, and the creation of decentralised, biodiverse food systems is the key to the design of a world without hunger. For this, a shift from globalisation to localisation is vital. Globalisation has reduced food to a commodity while expanding the control of agribusiness. Localisation reclaims food as nourishment, expands community control of food systems, and promotes food democracy and food sovereignty.” Vandana Shiva 


Together let’s discover a love algorithm

2479,solidarity-defi-making-crypto-accessible-to-our-c,"What is Solidarity DeFi?
We are a volunteer team of developers, engineers, and other technologists from a variety of backgrounds and countries working to build mission-driven crypto financial services to fund progressive projects. Our goal is to make it easy for progressive minded individuals to earn revenue through dApps and staking while supporting projects advocating for racial, economic, and gender justice. 

We're not interested in making more money for ourselves. The revenue we generate from our services goes towards covering our operating expenses, developing new tools, and, most importantly, supporting progressive efforts across the globe. We will provide regular updates and budget summaries to provide transparency and show our impact.

Would you like to build with us? Drop us a line at heythere@solidarity.finance.

Current Project: Gnosis Beacon Chain Validators & DAO
We're excited to support the future of Gnosis Chain by staking GNO, running validators, and providing the infrastructure for others to do the same. Members of our community who have interest in staking do not always have the background necessary to run their own server and node. We make this painless for our community to participate in staking by managing the infrastructure ourselves and running validators on their behalf at no cost.

Key to this project, is the development of smart contracts and an eventual DAO to securely hold and bundle GNO from our members that is used for staking. While Gnosis validators are already much more affordable than the ones on ETH2, the price still presents a barrier. By bundling partial units of GNO together, we can run full validators on behalf of multiple individuals. This project is still in the initial design phase, but we are thinking of it similarly to Rocket Pool.

Want to get involved in this project? Reach out! We'd love your support!

Current Project: Swarm Node on Mainnet & Community Web Hosting
Deepening our investment in Gnosis Chain, we are also running a full Swarm node. Income from the node's rewards is invested back into the network through covering the costs hosting websites on Swarm for community members and small nonprofit organizations.


Future Project: Stake Pool DAO
We are building a DAO to govern mission-driven staking pools on Cardano, Ethereum, Polygon, and Gnosis Chain. While useful for multiple purposes, in our own case this would allow for token holders to use our governance token (#SOLID) to vote on which social justice projects we should prioritize and fund and to weigh in on the future of the project as a whole. This project will allow our stake pool to operate more transparently and democratically.

Future Project: Ethereum Staking Pool (ETH 2.0)
Most of us can't afford to drop 32 ETH to become a validator by ourselves. Luckily, we have the option of pooling Ethereum from multiple individuals to meet that requirement. Given the excitement around the transition to proof of stake, we hope to add an Ethereum staking pool to our offerings in the near future.

Solidarity Governance Token (Cardano)
Since we're a new pool, early delegators are key to our success and our ability to fund social justice projects around the world. Will you help our pool get established? Delegators will be included in upcoming airdrop of our governance token: SOLID. 

Initially, Solidarity Governance Token/SOLID will have two main uses:
Voting on the social justice projects to fund as well as nominating new projects for consideration.
Voting on proposals that will shape the future of not just this pool, but Solidarity DeFi as well.

The amount of SOLID distributed to delegators is determined by 1) the amount being staked and 2) the number of epochs you've been a delegator.

What else are we working on?
We believe quality is more important than quantity and will only release stable, reliable, and high-quality services. This means we've been focused exclusively on our Solidarity Pool for ADA staking so far. That said, we're not a Cardano-only projects and we have Gnosis, Ethereum, Polygon, Polkadot and other blockchains on our list. We have a number of future projects and features under consideration including adding functionality to our governance token to allow for voting on funding priorities, additional staking pools, liquidity mining/yield farming, and other decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

3020,treasury-strategy-for-gitcoin-llama,"Problem

Gitcoin currently has the main treasury address with GTC tokens and the grants multisig wallet with ~30 tokens. Currently, there is no plan in place that contains the goals, policies, structure, and asset allocation for Gitcoin's treasury.

Deliverables

We will build and share the following with the Gitcoin community:

(1) Gitcoin treasury vision. This proposal will outline the vision and goals of the treasury and how it can serve Gitcoin. We will propose a structure for treasury management at Gitcoin.

(2) Investment Policy Statement. This proposal will serve as a policy guide for decisions relating to Gitcoin's treasury.

(3) Treasury strategy for Gitcoin. This proposal will include an initial treasury strategy within the guidelines of the Investment Policy Statement.

We will actively engage with the Gitcoin community. We will share these three documents with Gitcoin governance to get feedback. This feedback on the treasury vision and Investment Policy Statement will help inform our treasury strategy.

Goal

Gitcoin DAO is a long-term project and requires a long-term vision for its treasury.

Our goal is to ensure that the treasury does the following:

(1) Serves Gitcoin's mission of building and funding public goods

(2) Survives for a long time horizon across all market environments

(3) Grows in size
 
About Llama

Llama DAO helps DAOs and protocols manage their treasury. We have done work on the following DAO treasuries: Aave, Uniswap, Gitcoin, Radicle, FWB, ARCx, and PoolTogether. We have a group of the top people in DAO treasury management.

Llama & Gitcoin

Llama has already been actively involved with Gitcoin's governance, community, and treasury. Llama has participated in Gitcoin Kernel and two Llama members (Shreyas and William) are Gitcoin stewards. We have been in regular touch with Scott, Kyle, and Kevin from the Gitcoin team to advice them on questions relating to treasury management.

Here are few of our proposals on Gitcoin's treasury: 

(1) Proposal on how Gitcoin should deal with the AKITA donation. We proposed a 10% liquidation and a 90% Sablier stream, half of which goes to Gitcoin and half of which goes to AKITA.

(2) Proposal on a strategic asset allocation for Gitcoin's grants multisig wallet. We separated assets into three risk tranches: low risk, medium risk, and high risk, and proposed a framework to manage Gitcoin's grants multisig wallet.

Conclusion

Gitcoin needs a thoughtful treasury framework and strategy to further its mission, increase its longevity, and grow in size. We will work with the Gitcoin community to design this.

Background

There is a plethora of great content online (articles, videos, podcasts, tweets) that attempt to explain crypto/web3 concepts.

Curation around this content, however, is almost always superficial - usually an aggregation of links on a page or people to follow in a Twitter thread. Most attempts at curation heed no attention to a reader's prior exposure to a topic, include no key takeaways or excerpts that preview the content, and have no knowledge mapping between different pieces of content.

We can do a much better job here and raise the standard of what effective curation means by leveraging experts in instructional design and knowledge mapping to build a public good that's evergreen and open sourced for new contributions.

Audience

Our goal is to make this content useful for 3 personas:
-Brand new: people who have never consumed anything related to crypto, but may be aware of the space through news headlines or through friends. They might lean skeptical
-Explorer: People who have some exposure from consuming educational content, participating in the space by joining a DAO and/or investing in a crypto asset. They’re eager to learn more.
-Builder: People who are core contributors on crypto projects and/or create new content about the space. They want tactical, specific advice or nuanced deep dives.

Vision [Draft]

We're going to start by focusing on DAOs. We’ll build an interactive website for each persona above and plan to launch the DAO Lexicon sometime in February. We’ll use a CMS like Notion or Airtable to make it easy to update the content.

Next, we’ll vote on a new topic (e.g. NFTs, Public Goods, DeFi, Gaming) and ship that Lexicon a couple of months later. By then, we’ll have aligned on criteria for new submissions so that people can vote on new resources to be added with a clear process for deriving key summaries and excerpts. We’ll also start working directly with curators to compliment their work. For example, the curator could submit a list of links (e.g. Gaby Goldberg’s reading list) from which we’d generate a shareable page that includes summaries, key excerpts, tags, and mapping to other resources. 

Eventually, we’ll open source the process to maintain quality, dive deeper, and scale to any topic, including outside of crypto. We’ll add a social layer so that people who are interested in meeting with others learning the same topic can form study groups or learn directly from educators. We’ll partner with value-aligned organizations (e.g. Gitcoin/Kernel) to build this out.   

Team

This is a project initiated by the Crypto, Culture, and Society who introduced the concept of a “learning DAO” through Graeme Boy’s crowdfund on Mirror. They’ve delivered on the promise and raised their collective ambition to build liberal arts for crypto.

Bianca Mikaila is a product + visual designer based in Manila passionate about bridging technology & humanity. She spends most of her pushing on the boundaries of education through her design work. 
Bhaumik Patel has spent nearly a decade tinkering with different forms of online education from vocational bootcamps and networking communities to creator-led courses. He was brought on by Graeme  as the Course Manager working across different teams.

We’ll need a lot of help to get this project off the ground. Please contact Bhaumik on Twitter if you identify with the following skills and would like to get involved: 
Project / product manager(s)
Instructional designer(s)
UX/UI designer(s)
Developer(s)
Content creator(s)

We’d be excited to partner with orgs but would like clear commitments from directly responsible individuals that align with the skills needed above.

Created in 2017, CryptoSec was initially just a personal hobby project created to help beginners in the cryptocurrency space secure their funds from hackers and scammers. Pretty much just to have articles to link to people, instead of explaining and typing basic security concepts every time someone asks about them. But now that the cryptocurrency space is growing bigger and bigger, CryptoSec quickly turned from a hobby project, to a quite serious one.

1152,froshfeel,"Social network has become an integral part of our lives Sometimes we use it to interact with friends and family, catch up with the rest of the world or just to relieve boredom.
The only element lacking in these social media is educational interaction. Tertiary education can be a bit scary and students can do with a little help from knowledgeable people in their field but even the fact that the possibilities available with regards to tertiary education is so widely scattered across the internet makes it even so difficult.
Just imagine a platform where students can have access to institutions and businesses around them or where they can seek help from knowledgeable people and study groups from their field.
And to crown it all, wouldn’t it be wonderful to have all this in one easy to use platform? Well, there’s good news.
FROSHFEEL, a decentralized peer-to-peer student platform where students, professionals, businesses, institutions and educators can interact with one another on an educational level while combining the social elements of a student’s life and caters for a variety of young markets.
The users of the Froshfeel platform are; Institutions, Students, Business and educators. Froshfeel uses blockchain technology which ensures absolute transparency, secure and user-friendly platform. The creation of their token FROINS makes it easy to perform transactions such as paying college fees, student flights, buying textbooks, etc. and funds are not held by any third party and received instantly.

Why Froshfeel?
As a Contributor, you may be asking why you should contribute to this project. There are numerous unique selling points that form part of the froshfeel platform, however the most prominent are listed below:

1)Froshfeel aims to address the lack of resources and educational assistance available to students. The froshfeel platform is both an educational and social network intended for students. We aspire to build a large database of users that will be made available to businesses and institutions.

2)The student market consists of approximately 1.2 billion people. The need for a single platform, that combines all elements of a student’s tertiary educational journey and beyond, has become imperative. Froshfeel enables users to seek information, ask for educational assistance for exams and assignments, browse all available institutions and qualifications, view and apply to jobs and network with like-minded users. Users will also be able to buy and sell a variety of products and services through the platform.

3)Institutions will be able to provide particulars on qualifications available, contact details, locations, registrations processes , galleries and other essential information on the froshfeel platform.

4)Businesses will have access to our database in order to showcase and sell their products and services directly to users on the platform, anywhere around the world.

5)Educators will have the option to create classes, offer tutoring services, provide assistance to student users, host events and more

to accelerate the advent of the world where human creativity is fully respected, 
and everyone can enjoy the ownership of digital assets without the dependence on third party


Problems
NFT market has an asymmetry in demand and supply (Supply of NFT is too bigger than demand in the end, Chalie lee said)
NFT market should be revised to be a sustainable market (Vitalik Buterin said)
1) NFT can be a social good and great way to fund artists
2) With high level of social coordination, NFT can be used for public good by donating some part of the value to charity for orphans, animal protection, artists etc,.
3) Social media can help the process for the social coordination - making people believe NFT is worthy and good, because NFT is good.
There are too many NFT, so it's not easy to curate great artists, and they are having problems to display their valuable NFT


Solutions
We need to make a community of artists and collectors, not just a marketplace to sell NFTs
In the community, users will be able to interact to discuss and curate what is good artwork. 
We will give more chances to artists by providing 3D art gallery.
We will make collectors donate part of purchasement by giving them options to choose where and how much they want to donate (The Giving Block / Save the children etc,.)


What we believe is important
Decentralization
Pure Ownership
Human creativity
Helping others

While traditionally, users need to repeatedly keep track and pay for their storage after every fixed amount of time, Lighthouse manages this for them and makes sure that user files are stored forever. The aim is to move users from a rent-based cost model where they are renting their own files on cloud storage to a permanent ownership model. It is built on top of IPFS, Filecoin, and Ethereum based chains like Polygon, BSC, FTM. It uses the existing miner network and storage capacity of the filecoin network.

This leads to a variety of applications: 
Storage of financial data of Defi apps on decentralized storage in a verifiable and trustless way.
Long term storage of NFTs which are mostly stored on IPFS or centralized pinning services
Integration of decentralized storage with your current DApp without adding new technology into your stack
Reputation systems
DataDAOs and storage bounties, etc.

4200,endangered-tokens-invest-in-a-scarce-living-being,"Principles
The Endangered Tokens (ENTS) Foundation is an ecosystem in which landowners; NGOs, investors, artists and local communities actively collaborate with biodiversity preservation through the tokenization & conservation of Endangered Species, generating a value-driven economy.
 
 “Now you can adopt a tree, own a scarce store of value token and have proof of your contribution to its survival at the same time.”
 

Mission 
To form a decentralized investment community for biodiversity preservation, giving value and governance to stakeholders through Crypto Assets.
 
Vision:
As humans we need to revalue biodiversity and living ecosystems through the preservation of Endangered Species, which are invaluable assets to society. This future is possible with the support of decentralized economies driven by self-sustainable and healthy ecosystems in which the community collaborates to create the appropriate incentives towards regeneration.
 
One of our main goals is to change the concept of “Donations for conservation” to “Investment in conservation” by using scarce Endangered species as a store of value against inflation.
 
The Identified Problem
 
Endangered species are part of complex ecosystems that have become fragile due to human activity, which leads to a lack of biodiversity. Their preservation is expensive since there are almost no incentives for landowners and authorities to preserve them, and instead have become liabilities (because their maintenance doesn't bring relevant revenue). NGOs often struggle to finance conservation activities.
 
 
How can we solve it? 
 As humans we have a tendency for giving value to scarce things, gold, plutonium, fresh water, bitcoin, among other important scarce things. So, Why don’t we store our value within Endangered Species? They are intrinsically  scarce, they represent a unique genetic code and perform a unique task within a certain ecosystem. And now we can represent each specimen within a non fungible token as a way of offering the “Godparenthood” of that living being. Now you can adopt a tree, own a scarce store of value NFT and have proof of your contribution to its survival at the same time. This is the first token of the ecosystem and it is called “Elder Ents”. 
 
We want to return the natural value to Endangered Species and biodiversity through the tokenization of living specimens of endangered species and generate a global decentralized economic ecosystem of tradable assets and incentives to promote its survival and reproduction through the collaboration and engagement of the community. Thus acquiring value to stakeholders through the natural scarcity of the species, art, gaming, tourism, environmental education, local sustainable development, and carbon credits.
 
We want to connect through MRV technologies such us Georeferentiation, Satellite imaging, bioacoustics and other IoT devices to the NFT assets we create so it can be verified Inreal time, onchain, the preservation of these beings.

Setting up Project Bounties for adding projects to the Registry
GUIs to make the process of contributing easier
SDK libraries to make it easier to integrate the registry in platforms and projects
Github maintenance. Verifying commits and merging new projects

We are already thinking about and working on some kind of governance implementation. To ensure a high quality of information we need a strong community to contribute. The end goal is to allow the community to take over the general maintenance of the registry.

229,curadai-a-defi-based-stable-coin-for-curacao,"CuraDAI is a DeFI based digital currency that serves as a (better) alternative to the local currency of Curaçao, a small Caribbean island just north of Venezuela.  

Current Situation
The local currency, Netherlands Antillean guilder, is pegged to the price of United States dollars. This peg has many benefits, such as stable prices and volume, but also has some downsides. For example, all international transactions need to pass through an American correspondent bank. Besides adding extra costs and duration to the transactions the correspondent banks can also limit the local banks in their ability to process financial transactions. A result of this is the fact that it's near impossible to purchase or sell cryptocurrency from a local bank account.

For a more detailed overview please take a look at the CuraDAI Webpage or WIKI.

CuraDAI
We've first hand experienced the opportunities the Ethereum and DAI ecosystem provides and want to give this power to the local population. Therefore we're creating a version of DAI that leverages the DeFI ecosystem while tailoring to the local needs of Curaçao.

CuraDAI has the same unit of account as the local currency, is 100% backed by DAI and will enable digital p2p transactions opening up many new markets on the island.

Play around with the working prototype here and get yourself some CuraDAI 🏝️

Once we reach a tipping point with CuraDAO (around 1000 users) we will start document the entire process of building, launching and promoting CuraDAI. This would enable any other dollar backed currency (there are over 20 currencies pegged to the dollar!) to replicate CuraDAI for their own country. fair, efficient, and digital financial transactions for all!

CuraDAO
CuraDAI is connected to CuraDAO, a social-impact DAO on the island. Every time an individual uses the CuraDAI contract, to lock DAI and mint CuraDAI, a small fee (spread between the buy & sell price) is sent directly to the CuraDAO as a contribution to the island.

Please consider helping us build a DeFi based alternative to small nation currencies that are pegged to the dollar and empower a population of 160.000 to do business digitally and gain access to the opportunities of the DeFI space.

What we were able to do since Gitcoin Grants 5 thanks to you!

153,mailchain-email-like-messaging-built-on-blockchai,"Mailchain is blockchain-based email-like messaging with plain or rich text and attachment capabilities. Using blockchain protocols and decentralized storage, Mailchain delivers a simple, secure, messaging experience.
Account holders or owners of a public address now can communicate with their account or public address. Communication may relate to transactions, account actions or some type of notification.
Examples of use cases for blockchain messaging include invoicing, receipts, contacting users of a service or application developers.
The majority of blockchain protocols provide no standard way to handle messaging. Some account holders have sent messages as an encrypted or unencrypted string included in transaction data. Some applications work around the problem by asking users to link another method of contact (e.g. email address, phone number etc.) to an application. This compromises anonymity by asking users to link or reveal an identity. It also increases exposure to security risks, and relies on additional centralized services.
Supports Ethereum, Substrate, and Algorand.

3944,longevity-feature-film-the-last-generation-to-die,"In a near future when age reversal therapies are on the cusp of becoming reality, a scientist tries to save her father from natural death.

“The Last Generation to Die” is a cinematic quality full feature film on longevity. It’s a drama set in the future that examines the estranged relationship of two generations on the cusp of the end of aging and the ultimate merging of science and nature that will usher humanity into the next stage of evolution. 

""The Last Generation to Die"" began its life as a staff-picked, 393% funded Kickstarter short film. We’re extending that life as a full feature length film. The short film was in a variety of festivals, garnering excellent reviews, and serves as a proof-of-concept for the full length feature film. The feature film has a completed script, a producer attached, visual effects tests, seed money committed, and is currently in early development preparing for casting once we hit our next funding goal. The Last Generation to Die is also a semifinalist in the ScreenCraft Film Fund! 

View the short film trailer here: 

The Problem:
The problem we are tackling is how to get the public to be more onboard with longevity at large and how to communicate these ideas. We're making the rare positive film on longevity instead of dystopian.

The Solution:
Movies are extremely powerful. People also make decisions a lot based on emotion - not always entirely based on logic. This quote from David Sinclair's book sums it up well: ""Nothing begins with science. It all begins with stories."" A feature film has the ability to reach a very large audience through theaters and streaming services such as Netflix. A film & story reaching bigger audiences around longevity will be very powerful; it will change hearts and minds positively toward longevity and move the science faster, and ultimately reduce suffering. 





Funding:
Our grant request here is for a development funding round which will move the film to the next stages. The request is specifically for preproduction development costs, legal, and casting. These are all necessary to get the film to the next phase. In fact, our grant from Gitcoin Round 12 is currently paying for a casting director to help us reach known actors, which is the most key part to making an amazing film that connects to audiences and helps secure full financing. The film also has fiscal sponsorship through LEAF (lifespan.io) which allows for tax-deductible donations to be made to the film.

Why a Gitcoin grant?
Movies are very expensive to make. We will be getting funds from many different sources including private equity, donations, and other grants. Yet it’s very important to have a proper foundation of funding up front, as there are many development and pre-production costs that are needed up front to move to the next phase of filmmaking. Immediate and more urgent funding needs include legal, casting, and producorial and those steps in turn lead to greater access to funding in traditional film investment. In short, excellent seed funding -> yields next steps which allow for full funding and ultimately a better movie. Your support will go an enormous way in moving this film forward and you will be part of a groundbreaking film in which the convergence of art and science will serve as a powerful, global mission statement redefining aging, disease, and ultimately saving lives. 

Longevity Media DAO
Also, please support a new initiative that The Last Generation to Die is a part of! We are creating a DAO to help finance and support all longevity related media - movies, documentaries, videos and more. Please support the Longevity Media DAO Gitcoin grant here.  

Director's Statement: 
This film is really personal for me and most important as a sort of love letter to my own parents. My own father passed away recently, and this project became even more relevant and personal for me than ever. I now feel like I know on a deeper level what the main character is truly exploring. So while the shell of this movie is an elevated science fiction film dealing with existential questions about life and death on a grand scale, at its heart, it is an intimate story about a daughter and her father, loss, and the depths of love and choice. As a longevity advocate, I believe in promoting the science and ideas behind longer, healthier lives. As a filmmaker, I also believe in the power of stories and art to move people. I want to combine the two to make something that both works as a moving film, but also awakens people to the good ideas and reasons for healthy longevity.

We Connect.

THE PROJECT
 
The goal of Ethereum Explorer is to actively grow the network of talented, skilled people with the right experience to scale Ethereum, in order to make us more visible, more resilient, and more diverse in the immediate future.

Ethereum Explorer wants to become a community hub to attract, educate, and get new talent hired into the space.

The goal is to start small and humble as an indexer of existing content (communities, learning, events, ...) and then slowly scale to become a full Ethereum Academy (onboarding, advanced learning modules, networking events, job postings,…) if enough funding is secured. 
 
The focus is technical nor financial. Devs/traders are naturally drawn to this space.
The goal of Ethereum Explorer is to attract people with some years of professional experience and a track record of proven soft skills in a number of categories. 

+5 yrs of professional experience 
Overworked, low-attention span professionals
Non-technical (Communicators, managers, researchers, )
Looking for snack-sized easy-to-digest content 
Value-driven, ambitious & talented ‘10x’ people to help scale Ethereum on all levels 

Some examples of profiles (+ soft skills):

Communicators (community organization, writing, public speaking, storytelling, design, ...)
Leaders (conflict resolution, decision making, facilitation, mentoring, meeting management, ...)
Critical Thinkers (research, innovation, problem-solving, troubleshooting, ...)

How many of your friends have asked you: but what is Blockchain? What is Ethereum? And do you really think it matters?

We think it does. 
Let’s help them Explore Ethereum. 

THE MISSION
 
Ethereum Explorer wants to onboard talent to the Ethereum ecosystem to help bring the technology life cycle from innovators to early adopters.
Focus will be on: 

The How (onboarding, basic tools, …)
The Why (bigger picture, values, hacktivism)
The What (some of the best projects)
The Who (community, thought leaders)

Right now there is no DAO, no token, just this request for funding. 
The goal is to scale slowly while Exploring Ethereum.

3535,bankless-academy,"The Academy Vision ...

Bankless Academy was established by a core of passionate individuals with the vision of onboarding one-billion people to the Ethereum and Web3 ecosystems. We aim to become one of the ecosystem’s flagship “knowledge on-ramps” for the mass adoption of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance.

At the Academy, Users will learn about topics such as blockchain infrastructure, decentralized finance, NFT technology, and how to navigate the Web3 multiverse in a safe and secure way. Our Education Protocol aims to serve as the greater Web3 community as the open-source Public Good that guides students’ transformation from total rookie to becoming Bankless!
Such a transformation will be achieved primarily through the Academy’s fine-tuned lesson format that integrates essential reading with graphic and video elements to build the learner’s foundational understanding of advanced concepts.

Updates for GR14 …

Bankless Academy is pushing forward to build fundamental lessons that provide the foundation from which users can launch into their exploration of web3. Later lessons include NFTs, DeFi, DAOs, and other security topics.

Lessons

    • Live release: Intro to DeFi lesson fully live with finalized art.
    • Community beta: Blockchain Fundamentals lesson currently having illustrations added before public beta release.
    • Pipeline: Web3 security lessons to help users stay safe and avoid the scams in Web3. Don’t get got!

Community

Bankless Academy is building our community of Web3 explorers at https://gm.xyz/c/BanklessAcademy, welcoming and educating users as they learn and venture deeper into Web3.


Building Bankless Academy ...

With the touchstone goal of onboarding one-billion people to Web3, the genesis team set to work on defining the protocol’s approach to written content and visual style, to bring a personality to the brand that would act as the warm and openly extended hand that new users seek in this space. Meanwhile, our builders began building the core protocol framework that would become the first iteration of the Academy platform. 
We celebrated our initial launch in February 2022, with onboarding events taking place at ETHDenver.

In the weeks following public launch, Bankless Academy has been refining its operations:

    • Art and Branding has synthesised the protocol’s meta-narrative that firmly aligns with the BanklessDAO mission, vision, and values. This narrative has begun to shine through our original artwork, helping to immerse Web3 explorers in their journey through the realm of decentralised blockchain tooling and Bankless mastery!
    • Product Design has been consistently optimizing the platform, resulting in the sleek and stylish web interface online today. We are proud of how responsive, intuitive, and easy to use our platform has become.
    • Content has pulled together the knowledge of countless contributors, laying the groundwork for soon-to-be-released lessons that move beyond the protocol’s “User Initialization” stage and propel them into increasingly involved topics!
    • And Project Management has been selectively tracking and scaling the team to provide the most optimized funding runway possible for achieving the project mission.

Alongside these fixed departments, a larger pool of freelance contributors worked to launch Bankless Academy. These contributors have been paid out in bounties, and in some cases where the actual workload was more than the projected workload, some departments have foregone their own wages to assure team contributors get paid first. 

Building Bankless Academy has been a testament to the shared vision, values and desire for community building that are driving people to adopt cryptocurrencies today.

Walkthrough of the Academy’s ‘Minimum Viable Product’ ...

Below is a quick tour of the recently launched ‘Bankless Academy MVP-II’ interface.

Each course contains key information such as learning objectives and goals, knowledge gates, as well as closing with an interactive task that tests what users have learned. In the current iteration a POAP is awarded as proof-of-knowledge, though the team has plans to build its own proprietary badge system. Estimated completion time is included to let students know the commitment required, and a completion counter is visible to show its current popularity.





As the student progresses through the course, they experience pairings of written and visual content - similar to the screenshots below. Content ranges in presentation from text, diagrams, videos and images. In the future we will be looking to integrate more media types that excel the learning journey and can be integrated into our dApp. The journey through each course is tracked via the purple progress bar at the top of the application, to let users visualise their learning journey.



Our Ask to the Gitcoin Community ...

Beyond “Wallet Basics” and “Intro to DeFi,” the content team has a pipeline full of new lessons queued for development. Building an Academy lesson requires content curation, development of framework features, graphic concepting and design, video production, and more time consuming processes. By supporting our Gitcoin Grant, you will help Bankless Academy develop more lessons waiting in the pipeline, and build out new wings of the Academy protocol such as a public library and an interactive Badgeboard that tracks the progress of all users.

Our topics are not limited to DeFi, though this topic serves our primary alignment with the BanklessDAO vision. The Academy also aims to build and spread the education of blockchain infrastructure such as Sidechains and Layer 2s (like Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism and zkSync) to make experimenting with DeFi more accessible for those new to the Web3 multiverse. Furthermore, potential courses like Blockchain Fundamentals, Wallet Functions, Advanced Safety and Security Tips, Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake, and Buying/Selling NFTs via OpenSea all provide solid foundations for competent Web3 navigation. We even plan to cover dApp-specific topics such as ENS domain setup, Swapping / LPing on DEXs like Uniswap & Sushiswap, and more!

At the highest level, Web3 Education provided by Bankless Academy stands to empower humanity with the informed decision-making required in our digital future. We firmly believe that we align with the vision of the Gitcoin Community, and that together we can work to slay Moloch.

We seriously can’t wait to show you what we have to offer this space.

Let’s Impact Together!

Bankless Academy believes in the liberating effects of going Bankless and the impact our ideal can have on improving the financial stability and wellbeing of our world. With the help of the Gitcoin Community, we will accelerate the spread of an ungated Web3 education for everyone. 

Let’s help the world go Bankless!

3524,ourz,"	OURZ is a network of tools for creators, builders, and collaborators of all kind - to tokenize their work and receive perpetual split royalties. It’s built on top of the open source work from Zora, Mirror, and Gnosis.
	That’s the elevator pitch for it, at least. But at its core, OURZ is about taking back what’s ours.

	Instead of sale fees going towards marketplaces, royalty fees go to the creators. All of them. On every sale. Forever. There’s no limit to how many Ethereum addresses can be apart of a split. The splits can include a charity, a donation address for a vital software library in your project, a mere credit for inspiration, or anything else you can think of.



	Before COVID, I worked various gigs as a freelancer in photo & video production. I started this year out having never opened a code editor in my life. At some point early in the year, a photographer I work with regularly finally was getting back into the swing of shooting. We began discussing NFT’s, people we knew who had success in minting them before, and if we should give it a shot. At the end, we decided ‘not yet.’
We were waiting for a platform with three things:
1) Open access
- We couldn’t find any invites.
2) Respected artists & the display of their work
- This let us put the NFT on our own site / gallery, away from the twerking frogs
- There would be low marketplace fees
3) Split royalties
- If there’s one thing a creative freelancer hates, it’s waiting for payment.
- Let us include our team in the royalty, so no single person is responsible for handling it.

In March, I attended NFTHack – still with hardly any programming experience – and the idea of OURZ was born. I was going to find a team and build a NFT marketplace that satisfied the three points above! Woo!
I got some wonderful exposure to the open source community and was introduced to the Zora Protocol, but quickly realized that I simply did not have the coding skills needed to bring my idea marketplace fruition. Much to the dismay of my significant other, I’ve devoted most of my free time to learning and building since then. But the project is beginning to see the light of day (on Rinkeby):
- After multiple concept iterations, the design and structure of the contracts are nearly settled
(@Community: want splits to interact with your project/dApp/etc? Reach out!)
- The subgraph provides open API with detailed information about the split and its recipients
(Community: think something else should be included in the subgraph? Reach out!)
- The front-end is in the middle of being updated to accommodate the latest iteration of the contracts (just me at the moment, updates coming ASAP!).

⚠️ Project is under active development ⚠️ 

A significant portion of `art` is collaborative in nature. Photographers need models. Rappers and singers need producers. A short film requires a large crew of people. 

Cryptomedia will be no different.
 
At the beginning, the goal of OURZ was to allow creators to mint NFTs with split royalties. The project has undergone multiple revisions, now resulting in a combination of Mirror XYZ's Splits, and Gnosis' Safe contracts. Progress has reached the point to where it is now in public beta on Rinkeby.

With a Split Contract, an approved manager can: 
mint ERC-721s
curate auctions (Zora Auction House) 
start a crowdfund or Edition of ERC-1155 (MirrorXYZ)
start a PartyBid (PartyDAO) 
all with the proceeds/profits being split up among the recipients.

Any funds received from this grant round will go towards hosting and other costs related to running ourz.network.

179,algebraic-general-topology-and-discontinuous-anal,"In short: I did a math discovery that would be done shortly after 1937 but nobody before me was able to guess during about 60 years. I need money to advance this amazing project further. I also discovered Discontinuous Analysis (an improvement of the Newton's main discovery: continuous analysis).
I do mathematical research in fundamental abstract mathematics on the following topics:
A new subfield of General Topology, done in an algebraic way. It is a big revolution in mathematics. I think my research is worth prizes of Nobel level. See this page for all info about my research. This can be read even by beginning college students, by the way.
Theory of formulas (a smaller discovery but also interesting). Mathematicians studied almost everything except of formulas themselves.
I need money to support my life, buy books, etc., visit scientific conferences.
Project decription
Overview
Algebraic General Topology (= theory of funcoids, reloids, and their generalizations) is a wide generalization of general topology, allowing to express topological properties by algebraic formulas.
Victor Porton wrote his book ""Algebraic General Topology. Volume 1"" containing a description of this theory (with definitions, theorems, and proofs, as well as expository material allowing its reading by beginning students).
Intellectual Merit
Algebraic general topology is obviously an exceeding breakthrough because:
It is a new big branch of mathematics.
It is a very general theory based on humorously simple axioms.
It is expressed in algebraic form, not just a mess of quantifiers as old general topology.
It contains among other a definition of (generalized) limit of discontinuous function, what is expected to make a revolution in such fields as differential equations.
The general topology was generalized for an arbitrary kinda multidimensional case (while traditional general topology appeared to be 2-dimensional).
The idea of turning a category with additional structure to a semigroup is also novel.
The definition of funcoid is the biggest discovery in general topology since 1937 (when filters were defined).
The work also contains a generalization of filters on posets and other significant discoveries.
It is a common generalization of calculus and discrete mathematics.
Common generalization of continuity, uniform continuity, proximal continuity, Cauchy-continuity, discrete continuity.
It is connecting two previously thought unrelated branches of mathematics: general topology and ordered semigroup/monoid theory. Ordered semigroups are used to describe general topological properties in a novel way; general topology and calculus bring new concepts (such as three kinds of continuity or monovaludness) into ordered semigroup theory.
Author proposed a new way to define “sides” of manifolds and related things in a more natural way. We previously used the word “side” of a surface but didn’t really know what it really is.
The book is a good studybook. Also it is the world best reference on the topic of filters on posets.
Broader Impacts
As author's experience shows that we discover new unexpected results in traditional point-set topology using author's method. This tendency is expected to continue. General topology and thus related branches of science change radically.
(Generalized) limit of discontinuous function is expected to revolutionize differential equations, integrating, etc. and consequently such natural sciences as physics, engineering, and economics. It also simplifies existing research methods.
The project implies broad dissemination of my knowledge to the entire mathematical community to foster further science development.
The resulting book can serve as a base of college courses on different topics of algebraic general topology and for a college course on filters on posets and lattices, because it is written as a studybook.
If you are a teacher, you can make the following college courses using it as a studybook:
basic order theory
(co-)brouwerian lattices
filters and filtrators
funcoids
reloids
interrelationships between funcoids and reloids
multidimensional general topology
and more

P.S. Recently I discovered that many kinds of spaces are ordered semigroup actions: https://mathematics21.org/the-algebra-of-general-topology/

824,a-platform-to-catalyze-achievement-of-legislation,"	This grant is to raise funds to develop an open-source platform for the domain crowdfundedpolitics.com (website is currently inactive).

*The proposed platform provides the infrastructure for Andrew Yang’s ‘Democracy Dollar’ concept by incentivizing altruistic servitude in governance using smart contracts to hold accountability. 

	For the U.S. government to make a change on a federal level it is slow, tedious and often entails action being taken way too late — outside the government it means making a petition, rallying support, and hoping it garners enough attention in the form of scrutiny that a politician enacts on said petition. Simultaneously, Citizens United allows corporations to legally bribe our politicians, creating a dynamic where special interest groups and conglomerates hold a lot of power (They’re providing money to politicians in the form of a quid-pro-pro where said politicians ensure they do their job in the donors favor). 

	Citizens United has faced backlash, although it claims rights on the basis of the constitution so it’s rather pointless to make the fight about removing Citizens United. Politicians aren’t going to turn down free money & they certainly aren’t going to make it illegal for them to be able to do so. 

	The key is to give them ‘good’ money, funded by the public, to dilute the impact of the ‘bad’ money.  

	My proposal is a smart contract money support system for donation pools for politicians. I know, it’s a mouthful.

	In a public feed, users list laws or courses of action they’d like to be put into legislation. At the same time, citizens contribute money towards these posts by directly holding a politician accountable with a smart contract that executes when money is donated. The smart contract holds predetermined stipulations (actions that must be obliged by for said money to be released). The money is then released when the majority of the post donors give approval.  

	Additionally, post creators should have the ability to set parameters for the dispersal of the money such as amount, time, and politicians needed for support. This can allow for certain objectives to be achieved that require specific numeric pedigrees. 

Example 1

Post: Set congressional term limits 
About: X (open-source contribution) 
Financial goal:xxxM
Identified needed supporters: xxx (x% achieved)

Example 2

Post: Allow health insurance companies to offer coverage across state lines to increase competition and insight better packages to be offered
About: X (open-source contribution) 
Financial goal:xxxM
Identified needed supporters: xxx (x% achieved)

Example 3

Post: x federal/local oversight committee on x cause
About: X (open-source contribution) 
Financial goal:xxxM
Identified needed supporters: xxx (x% achieved)

	Separately, politicians will have their own accounts where they can support different posts. Supporting a post would mean adding their name to the chosen smart contract donation pool (if possible). They’re then put into the limelight for public observation and scrutiny to ‘fight’ for the objectives relayed in the post that they’ve supported. The opportunity for politicians here is the attempt to receive majority approval in regards to accomplishing ultimatums relayed in the smart contract in order to receive their predefined cut of any money donated.

	This creates a win-win situation. Politicians can receive much greater and continued financial support from the public to take on virtuous deeds while also providing transparency about their financial obligations. Citizens can commit direct financial support towards legal change as opposed to contributing money to a politician's campaign where there’s no certainty of how much money will be allocated to what and if the politician receiving the donation will fulfill their “promise” in the end.

	In this way, change can happen faster because citizens are on the same playing field as corrupt institutions by enacting direct financial persuasion. 

	Whether you’re a Republican, Democrat, or lie somewhere in between, the state of affairs in the United States suggests these are merely opposite wings of the same bird. It’s about time the body of what we’ve been flying for is ascertained and the strings on the puppets are revealed!

2763,rugpullindexcom-illuminating-the-dark-forest,"Hi Gitcoiners, it’s me, Tim, the founder of rugpullindex.com.

As part of Gitcoin’s GR14 quadratic funding round, we’d like to participate and enumerate our contributions to the Ethereum community here.

Here's how we're contributing useful stuff to the Ethereum community:

We’re the authors of a stateless and reliable JSON-RPC call library called eth-fun.
We’re actively researching rollup infrastructure and seeking to build scalable dapps. Check our “awesome-ethereum-rollups” list of resources.
Finally, we’re contributing directly to the Ethereum ecosystem by releasing fundamental infrastructure legos as, e.g., this implementation of an on-chain optimized sparse Merkle tree to the public.
We've submitted EIP-4973 Account-bound tokens and shipped a CC0 Reference implementation

Why Are We Building Rug Pull Index?

🦺 We believe that a future web3 can be a safe space for all users, not only technically-sophisticated ones. We want a future WITHOUT rug pulls left and right! And hence, we call it our mission to make Web3 staking and investing safer through algorithmic positive reinforcement. We want to take attention away from bad actors and bubble up good actors.

How Are We Funded?

We don’t want to launch our own token yet, and we’re not planning to raise funds from VCs either. In fact, we’re considering ourselves for now as a public good. None of our users is charged so far, and all of our work has been available for free for over a year.

We’d first like to iterate and potentially explore different business model ideas before we settle down on doing one thing. Monetization is a big part of our thinking, but in the web3 space, there are still a lot of moving parts, and so we’re not committing ourselves to any type of funding yet.

We’d appreciate receiving a larger portion of funds from Gitcoin, as this would allow us to earmark that amount towards actually rating Ethereum-based tokens for safety too.

Conclusion

I hope I was able to convince you that investing in Rug Pull Index is also of value to the Etherum ecosystem. Me, Tim, I’ve been invested in the ecosystem for quite a while, and also with my personal blog, I’m trying to meaningfully contribute by talking about the space’s issues critically.

Everyone at Rug Pull Index, we'd appreciate any contribution and hope to meet you on our Discord. Until then, safe staking!

3992,nmn-nr-human-trial-of-improved-healthspan,"Background:

As we age a molecule called NAD, which is vital for our metabolism, goes down. But when NAD levels are supported in mice trials, the mice could run 45% longer and their grip strength was 20% stronger. Furthermore they had less sickness, reduced weight gain, and reduced rates of diabetes.

Human trials are on-going, and so far we have data showing that supporting NAD levels is safe and it improves metabolism in human muscle. We also have some initial data showing that supporting NAD levels may speed up the recovery from COVID-19 infections. The early results are promising, and a trial is happening right now to see if NAD support will improve the running performance of older adults.

Because of the exciting data that’s come through so far, many people around the world have started to use supplements to improve their NAD levels. Repeatedly we hear reports that once people start taking these supplements, their hair and fingernails start to grow faster, and their skin looks more youthful. These changes might be the first signs that supporting NAD metabolism will improve human health, just like it does for mice.

Why Is this important?

A great deal of emphasis in the healthspan field is currently placed on biomarkers such as DNA Methylation Clocks, or inflammation markers such as hs-CRP. In our view, this is unfortunate because what really matters are functional outcomes: if a person can run faster because of NAD supplements, it doesn’t matter what a DNA Methylation Clock estimates that person’s age to be, they will want to continue using the NAD supplement.

Therefore, these initial anecdotal reports from people saying that their skin, hair and fingernail health improved after using NAD supplements may be the first functional outcomes indicating that these supplements can improve healthspan. If these results prove to be true in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, it will firstly provide an actionable way for people to improve their health, and secondly it strengthens the hypothesis that NAD supplements may improve other aspects of health.

Where will the funds go?

To robustly investigate these anecdotal reports, we proposed a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study of Nicotinamide Riboside (an NAD precursor) that primarily compares the rate of wound healing. The speed of fingernail and hair growth would be secondary outcomes.

Supplements that support NAD levels are an extremely exciting area as you can see, and the trial we propose would give us the first indications that the health benefits seen in mice may
also apply to humans.

2776,pulp-network,"The distributed publishing platform for web 3. HackFS 2020 finalist

# A Semiformal Definition for the pulp protocol

v0.0.1 - alpha; Work In Progress

pulp is a protocol that specifies a set of behaviors to facilitate the regular publication and subscription of text-first content on the distributed web: authors use pulp to publish content, readers use pulp to consume content, and aggregators use pulp to surface content.

## The Characters

The three characters involved in pulp are the Author, the Subscriber, and the Aggregator.

The **Author** is a content creator. This is an individual who thinks she has something interesting to say on a regular basis and is brave enough to shout it out to the rest of the universe. The Author's primary medium is written, which is why she chose pulp: pulp is designed to facilitate text-first publications. Importantly, it is not a protocol intended for video-first, image-first, or audio-first publications. The Author is also not a website designer: she is interested in writing prose, not code or markup. Back in the day she published on Medium.com, then switched to Substack a year ago. But she fears lock-in, doesn't agree with certain platform policies, and is generally excited about web3. When pulp launched, she jumped at the chance to use a truly decentralized publishing platform.

The **Subscriber** is a content consumer. This is an individual who enjoys regular text-first content in a convenient form. The Subscriber is someone who puts his trust in particular Authors for the recurring content they provide. The Subscriber is also willing to compensate the parties that serve him the content conveniently because he recognizes that the convenience of and the recurrence of the content is as valuable as the content itself. The Subscriber is using pulp largely because his favorite Authors are writing on pulp.

The **Aggregator** is a party that serves both the Author and the Subscriber. It is a company or organization that provides a software client that implements the pulp protocol. The Aggregator is profit-driven, and designs the software client to serve the Author and the Subscriber in a way that maximizes profit. But Aggregators beware: it is a low-margin proposition. A good Aggregator recognizes the needs of the Author: marketing, subscriber tracking, a clean writing experience; the needs of the Subscriber: convenient content delivery; and the needs that overlap: content discovery. Importantly, where an Author and Subscriber are concerned: the Aggregator is optional. A Subscriber may always seek out an Author directly and vice versa. The Aggregator is only as useful to this flow as it makes itself: by the nature of the pulp protocol, this middle party is optional.

## The Artifacts

There are four artifacts: the Publication, the Article, the ArchivedArticle, and the Draft.

The **Publication** represents a channel for recurring text-first content. The pulp Publication is the magazine or the newsletter of web3. Each Publication is owned by an Author; it is the owning Author who writes the stream of written content emanating from the Publication. The owning Author of a Publication can also delegate publishing permsissions to other Authors should they so choose.

The **Article** represents a discrete unit of written content. Upon the release of the Article, the Aggregator collects the content and makes it available to the Subscriber in the convenient format that the Subscriber signed up for. Alternatively, the Subscriber may seek out the Article by visiting its unique address through any browser of their choosing. At the option of the Author, an Article may be considered private and made available only to paying Subscribers; this is accomplished by publishing the encrypted version of the Article and distributing keys to paying Subscribers. This is an imperfect but sufficient method for preventing content re-sharing. Any Article may be edited by its Author at any time; the Author may optionally announce the edit and back-link the original Article.

The **ArchivedArticle** represents a momentary and immutable snapshot of an Article as it existed at a point in time. Its persistence is funded by any party who wish to preserve it for posterity. The ArchivedArticle includes metadata about the article such as Author, Publication, publicaiton date, etc. It is stored in an utterly distributed manner on the Filecoin network: once archived, no organization on Earth is powerful enough to censor or modify its existence, not even the original Author.

The **Draft** represents an unpublished Article. The Draft is stored in the same manner as any Article, but it is kept secret to the Author through encryption with the Author's own private keys. At any time, the Author may choose to release a Draft to the world by decrypting it and labeling it an Article.

## Technical Overview

An **Author** is identified on the pulp protocol by a public/private keypair. This keypair controls a corresponding Ethereum address for payments and ENS identification. It is also used to generate other keys, one which control an IPNS address for publishing content and another which encrypts and decrypts private Articles and Drafts.

A **Subscriber** is identified on the pulp protocol by a Public/Private Keypair and optionally an email address. Importantly, Subscribers of public content can remain completely anonymous. Even Subscribers of paid content may remain pseudonymous behind an ethereum key.

A **Publication** is an IPNS address mapped to a globally unique friendly name. A Publication is referred to by its multi-address: `pulp/<ipns-address>/<publication-name>`. The global uniqueness of the friendly name is enforced by the pulp publication registration contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

An **Article** is a file stored on the filecoin network. It is referred to by its multi-address: `pulp/<ipns-address>/<publication-name>/<article-name>`. Because it is nested under an IPNS address, an article is liable to be edited by the person who controls the keys to the IPNS address: its original Author.

An **ArchivedArticle** is a point-in-time snapshot of an Article that is stored on the Filecoin network. It is referred to by its ipfs hash: `ipfs/Qm....` For this reason it is immutable, even by the Author. Any Author, Aggregator, Subscriber, or even non-participant may decide to _archive_ an Article as an ArchivedArticle on the Filecoin network. This captures the Article and article metadata (like publication date, publication-name, author address) and persists it for some time at the expense of the archiving party.

The IRL Art team is a collective of artists, art directors, project managers, metaverse builders, and developers focused on high impact creative projects. Together we’ve provided paid opportunities to over 1500 artists on an unquantifiable amount of projects. We program art, large events, education opportunities, build and strengthen art communities through a wide array of different mediums and industries. 

We’ve are passionate about providing paid opportunities for artists through hosting public calls for artists through irlart.com: 
6 muralists for Black History Month in RiNo, 
60+ muralists for The Black Love Mural Festival, 
12 muralists for Far Out Murals, 
10 painters for Art Box, and 
60 painters for a two floor exhibit at the McNichols Building. 
8 Subgrants in partnership with Decentraland

Our projects have intentional focus on serving:
Urban and Rural communities
Black communities
Minorities
Upcoming and mid career Artists

Our mission is to engage, educate, empower, and inspire.

We are highly focused on lessening current operational costs through the use of our platform by integrating open source web3 tools. We have self funded all development and the ongoing costs of maintaining our platform. We’ve intentionally not taken any investors, so that we are able to maintain an uncompromised mission, that authentically serves our community of artists. We want to continue to explore how web3 tools can benefit the collective’s coordination, governance, asset management, transparency, and overall arts community resiliency.

Since 2019 we have worked with and on boarded over 500 artists into NFTs, Blockchain, and DeFi through various DAO and event funded art exhibits. We have covered all their costs for minting, offer them 1-1 time to help them learn every step with support, and allocate reward tokens to them to set them off on their DeFi journey. We manage a discord channel with open access to all of our proposals for others to use as guides and templates for submitting their own proposals. Additionally, we’ve put together an editable Resource doc for artists that anyone can reference and add to.

Just this year, since producing the ETHDenver 2021 Art Gallery, we have self produced the following at our physical gallery and events location at 2611 Walnut Street Denver, CO: 

Black Love Art & Crypto, 
Motion Gallery, 
Sporkdao Auction, 
Pop up or Plug in,
BLMF NFTs
Sensitive Content 
U’R,L
VIRAL
ETHDenver 2022
Gitcoin Solar Punk
Architek.firm Exhibit (upcoming)

We work in partnership with the RiNo Arts District and Edens to receive free and discounted gallery spaces to produce these exhibits IRL in Denver, Colorado.  We recreate our galleries virtually in parcels provided to us to use for free or low cost in cryptovoxels, somnium space, and decentraland. We work diligently to keep our operating costs low, continuously creating and refining the least extractive and fair models for our artists and clients. 

By continuing our education, through participating in the web3 space, we hope to create more support, sustainability, and scalability around our work. One of our future goals is to participate in Jason Weiner and Yev Muchnik’s cohort program to create a legal framework and roadmap for IRL Art as a formal cooperative.

Problem Statement
Blockchain data often contain valuable information when presented/used correctly, but require technical skills out of reach for most people.

Our Solutions
With the power of modern day front end development tools, we can build a full-fledged frontend website which allows users to directly interact with blockchain nodes to grab what is typically known as ""on-chain data"".
AlphaOnChain helps user interact with onchain data by making it useful and digestible.
We present data through various dashboards which allows users to view blockchain data without technical know-hows.
Our data is filtered and categorized accordingly, allowing users to further leverage on it for analysis or to build applications

3946,biomimetic-vascular-model-for-studying-vascular-a,"With the increase in obesity and diabetes in Americans and as the population ages, vascular diseases are becoming epidemic and remain as unresolved medical challenges; peripheral artery disease alone affects 8.5 million people. For example, thrombosis and its complications are among the principal reasons for morbidity and mortality caused by cardiovascular diseases. While hemostasis is a physiological response to the vascular injury and is locally limited to the site of bleeding, thrombotic events are the pathologic responses to this type of injury, and can lead to partial or complete obstruction of vessel lumen and impairment of the blood flow. An acute thrombotic event may require administration of thrombolytic agents as therapy. However, there is often incomplete resolution of the thrombus; infiltration and proliferation of surrounding cells into the thrombus can lead to its fibrosis. This remodeling process further reduces the physiologic breakdown of the thrombus and the overall efficacy of anticoagulation/thrombolytic therapy. 

So far, the role of biomechanics (i.e., biological forces) in aging of vascular cells and relationship with vascular diseases has remained poorly understood. In the native blood vessels, the naturally occurring dilations and constrictions translate into behavioral changes in various vascular cell types, such as smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Whereas endothelial cells are primarily exposed to forces caused by the blood flow and the blood components, smooth muscle cells are mainly exposed to cyclic stretching forces, which play a key role in controlling tone of the vessel and concomitant blood pressure. Pathologic levels of these biological forces can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels as well as induce numerous types of vascular injury and inflammatory responses. 

Recent advances in the field of organ-on-a-chip have led to generation of various models of human organs. These organ-on-a-chip devices—usually made on substrates of plastic or rubber, not silicon—contain living cells. These cells are organized to form a three-dimensional (3D) bit of artificially grown tissue, that operates like a human organ but on a scale of cubic millimeters. A liver microtissue might be functional enough to metabolize the painkiller paracetamol. A lung microtissue could simulate breathing. And a vascular microtissue would be able to transport blood and connect the other organ models. However, none of the currently existing blood vessel-on-a-chip models was used to evaluate the interplay between biomechanical forces, vascular aging, and vascular disorders. 

The overarching goal of this intended project is to base on the rich framework of relevant technologies that are existing in Dr. Zhang’s laboratory at Harvard, to develop a truly biomimetic blood vessel model system generated with human-derived vascular cells in a native vessel-like format, that allows application of relevant stretching forces for emulating and studying vascular aging (Fig. 1). We hypothesize that this advanced blood-vessel-on-a-chip model will allow human vascular cells from different age groups in a biomimetic microenvironment and that the application of biomechanical forces will enable investigations on vascular aging and onset of various events associated with vascular disorders, in the context of aging. The model will be used for i) fundamental biological studies to understand the underlying interplay between biomechanical forces, vascular aging, and vascular disorders; and ii) screening a range of candidate compounds for their effects of on alleviating vascular cell aging-related behaviors and manifestations. 

Dr. Zhang is currently an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Associate Bioengineer in the Division of Engineering in Medicine at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Zhang directs the Laboratory of Engineered Living Systems, whose research is focused on innovating medical engineering technologies, including 3D bioprinting, organs-on-chips, and bioanalysis, to recreate functional tissues and their biomimetic models (including those of the blood vessels) to push the boundaries of regenerative medicine and personalized medicine. In collaboration with a multidisciplinary team encompassing biomedical, mechanical, electrical, and computer engineers as well as biologists and clinicians, his laboratory seeks to ultimately translate these cutting-edge technologies into the clinics. He is an author of >250 peer-reviewed publications and his scientific contributions have been recognized by >40 awards. 

The funding goal of this project is tentatively set at $500K. We are excited to participate in Gitcoin Round 13.

2077,reap,"What is Reap?

Reap is a unique decentralized application that bridges land property owners to farmers in Africa. It provides a verified and authentic two-sided land markets in vernacular land markets. It achieves this by employing cryptographic signatures to attest property ownership and property usage rights on Ethereum.

Why Reap?

Land markets in Africa are dominated by intermediaries and regulatory structures that make the process of leasing a property expensive and time-consuming. Parties in the business are bind with a legal document that can be altered in the course of the lease period which can lead to an expensive legal battle that the farmer cannot afford to win. 

Land property owner also leaves their property to be managed by an intermediary who can misuse the property without the owner's knowledge.
There exist legal and financial implications if a legal bind is disputed largely on the part of the farmer, leaving the vernacular land markets in Africa to big enterprises and multinational corporations to exploit.

How does Ethereum fit in all this?

Ethereum is a true hybrid cryptosystem, whereby transactions are signed and verified using asymmetric cryptography(public and private keys). Smart contracts running on Ethereum can be coded to simulate property ownership rights using cryptographic signatures. 

Land property owners can attest to property ownership by signing the property title document digitally using their keys. Additionally, tenant agreements can be signed by involved parties using their keys and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain and await fulfillment. 

With this mechanism, property owners can attest to property ownership by just providing their cryptographic signature and tenant can attest to property usage rights by just providing their cryptographic signature.

How can you help?

Contribute to the grant. Every donation will be used in marketing to educate farmers and property owners about Ethereum and blockchain technology in Africa.

3998,lifespanio-meets-web3-crowdsourced-clinical-trial,"Powering Up Longevity Crowdfunding and Crowdsourcing With Blockchain Technology

Launched in 2015: Lifespan.io has become the most-trafficked news, advocacy, and crowdfunding platform dedicated to longevity research in the world - producing thousands of articles, reaching tens of millions with top-tier video projects, and raising > $750,000 for carefully selected, high-impact research projects.



Thus far this has all been done on Web2 architecture, but transforming Lifespan.io to use Web3 architecture will allow us to go so much further —  implementing new models of matched crowdfunding specifically designed to engage millions, run first-in-kind crowdsourced clinical trials, and create machine-learning based biomarkers of aging which can both accelerate the entire field of aging research and also pave the way for exciting applications in the coming future of metaverses. 

New For Gitcoin Round 14!
Thanks to your contributions in GR13 we already have prototypes ready to move forward, and blockchain allies ready to help us - such as VitaDAO, CureDAO, and the team right here at Gitcoin — all we need is the financial activation energy to start the cascade - and that is where you come in! 



How Your Support Can Help Us Drive Forward Healthy Human Longevity
Your support will allow us to bring on the team we need to implement a new form of blockchain-facilitated crowdfunding - similar in nature to the quadratic funding used here on Gitcoin, but which is geared to raising a large-scale level of support for a single targeted project, both in terms of funding and number of individuals supporting it. 

Once implemented, this mechanism will couple perfectly with Lifespan.io’s existing social media reach and massive YouTube channels to simultaneously raise funds for important research projects and build the architecture we will need to facilitate first-in-kind crowdsourced clinical trials which make use of physiological biomarkers. In this video Lifespan.io president Keith Comito explains the value of this:



The demonstration of a decentralized clinical trial which yields any positive result, such as remediation of dementia, for example, would be an earthquake to the existing clinical trials system, catalyzing a much-needed transformation towards properly leveraging modern technology. Together we can make it happen.

Cryptocurrency and Life Extension Have Always Been United
Ever since the birth of blockchain technology, there has been an indelible connection between it and the desire for life extension — all the way back to the early cypherpunks and cryptocurrency founders such as Hal Finney, forward to the pioneers of the present such as Vitalik Buterin. You can be part of this grand tradition of transcending boundaries - be they financial or biological - in the service of all humankind.

DoinGud is a social app and marketplace focused on inspiring creativity and positive social impact. 



At DoinGud, we strive to be community-owned and curated. We see the future of the web as a decentralized place where creators, curators, collectors, and communities can all benefit from forward-thinking web3 tools. We help them tap into sustainable income streams, engage creatively with their patrons, and create lasting impact for the causes they care about. 

Our platform enables creators to choose verified charities and causes and allows streaming a minimum of 5% of primary sale proceeds and 2.5% of secondary sale royalties. The beta version of our platform is already up and running and can be found at doingud.com. There are no minting fees for users thus providing a cost-effective way for them to focus on what they do best: create.

In addition to our approach of streaming sale proceeds, we are adding curation mechanisms that allow anyone including individuals, DAOs, collectives, and brands to curate NFTs from various creators for hosting exhibitions and community drops. With this foundation in place, and as we continue building a better product and stronger community, we will be in a position to launch our own DAO in the near future.




Our ultimate vision for DoinGud is to create a Decentralized Social Impact (DeSI) Protocol that any other platform, marketplace, or protocol can plug into and stream money to verified causes. With this, we intend to disrupt every business model by creating a symbiotic ecosystem between creativity, business, and social impact that provides a path to increasing prosperity for all participants.

We have already built a recognizable brand in the space with a great design and content team and we have been actively engaging in interviews with thought leaders in the space, creating event recaps, and building online educational resources. 

We are also seeing strong interest from partners and other protocols in the space that want to be aligned with a platform like ours associated with positive social impact. Some examples of these partnerships include Gitcoin and IRLUnderground who both hosted their NFT exhibition galleries at EthDenver on our platform. In addition to these notable partnerships, we formed strong ties with other key protocols, DAOs and service providers including polygon network, ceramic network, Arweave, Filecoin, Civic, The Giving Block, Giveth, Token Engineering Commons, and The Commons Stack.  We believe our platform offers a unique opportunity for recognizable names in the Web3 space to give back and align with their ethos and overall values.

The Open Science DAO
🧪 science needs a firmware update 

Pay to learn, fractured archives, and adversarial incentives make it clear: Science needs a firmware update. Did you know that less than 10% of data collected by publicly funded research in the US is published alongside their papers? Or that an average 70% of researchers have failed to replicate their colleagues’ work across disciplines, including psychology, physics, and biology? 

A hyper competitive culture in academia precludes collaboration while existential challenges requires immediate scientific solutions. A flood of knowledge artifacts and a talent overflow of highly trained experts have overwhelmed the capacity of research institutions to identify strategic directions and decide efficient allocation of resources for the pursuit of discovery. Never before has there been so many data, papers, and protocols, but so little accessible knowledge. 

What is OpSci?
OpSci is a non profit organization building a community of science activists, researchers, organizers and enthusiasts that have come together to work on the problems of science today. Knowledge creation is currently struggling with challenges on data sharing, reproducibility, incentive alignment, coordination, and intellectual ownership and we want to coordinate the community to begin challenging these problems. Key to our approach is the seeding of a flourishing decentralized science (DeSci) commons that empowers individuals to innovate and pursue novel discoveries in collaboration with traditional institutions.

What is DeSci?
Decentralized Science (DeSci) is what we at OpSci call digital communities of citizen scientists that coordinate to produce falsifiable statements about the natural world, test these hypotheses through reproducible methods, and make their insights accessible as building blocks for other knowledge-seekers.

OpSci supports DeSci with a Web3 stack that uniquely makes it possible to crowdsource funding, share data, control access to sensitive information, transform digital research commodities into value-producing assets that sustain the ecosystem with data marketplaces, and achieve incentive alignment across a diverse community. From funding to reputation to token engineering, OpSci is uniquely Web3.

What does OpSci do?
OpSci is a scientific ecosystem that unlocks data silos, coordinates collaboration, and democratizes funding. The OpSci ecosystem is powered by the Decentralized Science (DeSci) Stack, a software development kit linking decentralized finance with data markets, privacy-preserving cloud services, and the power of smart contracts to coordinate global citizen science communities together around a collectively determined incentive structure. Here are some of our active projects:

1) WTF is a Holonym
OpSci is currently incubating the development of web-native tools for scientific identity, reputation and credentials management from March to October 2022. OpSci will work closely with the community to integrate existing Web3 technology with academic account and credential systems. The developed tools are intended to be provided as open source in their release-ready format as a free, or minimal cost service, for early DeSci adopters.

2) OpSci Commons 
The OpSci Commons is an open-access data commons sustainably designed to capture the value of scientific enterprise in a decentralized cloud services marketplace. The OpSci Commons was built to house the largest collection of high quality open source data that can be queried, discovered, and analyzed all in one place. We are building tools to migrate up to 250TB of neuroscience data unto decentralized file storage, and making this open data directly available to over 20,000 neuroscience researchers around the world. We expect exponential growth of research projects over a period of 5 years beginning in Q4 2022 as we tailor cloud service needs to researchers to scale adoption.


3) Community Conferences & DeSci.eth
In addition to software development, OpSci also supports DeSci community conferences. Our most recent event, attracted over 1000 attendees, 7 hack-a-thon projects (one of which was a finalist in the Harmony ZK rollups category), and 23 speakers.  We plan to continue hosting DeSci events pending community funding.


4) Scholarship & Research
The OpSci ecosystem also support Fellowship programs that have resulted in multiple products and features, such as the Decentralized Autonomous Research Community Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Elements (DARC-SPICE) and vScholar. OpSci also collaborates with other research organizations to generate academic papers that push the field of DeSci forward, such as our recent pre-print that places DeSci in the context of cognitive models for sense making, perception, and action.


4) How do we use the funding
OpSci is a non-profit organization (501c3 pending) that deploys all funding to support community growth such as travel grants, conference expenses, fellowships, and bounties that help the DeSci community accomplish it's goals and gain traction on solving clearly identified problems in Science today.

749,mass-adoption-llc,"As the Decentralized Finance space continues its exponential growth - alongside the rest of the crypto-ecosystem - newbies have found it difficult to digest and comprehend some of the utilities these projects aim to deliver; let alone how to onboard and properly maneuver through these platforms/applications. Due to these intricacies, newbies become discouraged, overwhelmed, or impatient with concepts such as: private keys, secret phrases, Web3 enabled wallets, and the onboarding process itself. 

Unlike most online crypto-education platforms that only offer extensive TL;DR articles, Mass Adoption aims to expedite the crypto-adoption rate by cutting out the jargon and onboarding newcomers in the most simplistic way possible; providing & offering visual walkthroughs that your grandma can understand. At the end of the day, we want potential users to feel comfortable using these platforms/applications - same way they feel comfortable using CashApp, Paypal, Facebook, or even a traditional bank account. It is our goal to expose the endless value propositions these DeFi projects have to offer, especially in terms of self-sovereignty, trustlessness, and security. 

Mass Adoption LLC. has worked closely with well-respected organizations such as: Blockchain Education Network, MouseBelt University, and BlockGeeks to further educate and onboard newcomers to various wallet interfaces and decentralized applications. 

With the assistance of the crypto-community, we plan to further expand our operations in anticipation to onboard and eventually help fund some of our member's onboarding processes.

3853,stopping-alzheimers-with-light-and-sound,"Building a Headset to Test, in Humans, Promising Research That Shows Light and Sound of Certain Frequencies May Actually Fight Against Alzheimer's Disease.

The search for an effective pharmacological (drug based) therapeutic for dementia, particularly those stemming from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), is ongoing, expensive and, to date, has been fraught with multiple dead ends. Despite this bleak outlook, we have strong evidence to suggest that present day technology can be effectively organized to develop a promising therapy to defeat Alzheimer's Disease.

New For Gitcoin Round 14!
Thanks to your contributions in GR12 we already have a system demonstrating verifiable neurological effects based on applied stimuli. If you can help us reach $50,000 in this round we will be able to acquire the equipment we need to build an inexpensive and scaleable prototype capable of administering therapies to the widest amount of people possible.



Evidence for effectiveness 
Published scientific evidence strongly supports the development of treatments for Alzheimer's disease that are non-pharmacological in nature. Evidence also suggests that multiple such non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) can act in concert, thereby increasing the effectiveness of such therapies in delaying and even reversing AD. Despite these positive developments, traditional clinical trials for NPIs have only been done on a relatively small scale and testing for efficacy has been mostly performed at clinical centers using standard paper-based assessment tests. This has been mainly due to the complexity in administering an NPI based treatment in a traditional clinical setting. 

The PIA MindSet 
We are developing a therapeutic device, the PIA MindSet, that incorporates multiple NPI interventions that are safe and have shown promise in both animal testing and in human clinical trials. This headset could be directly marketed and sold to users, where they themselves would directly participate in operating the device and submitting data for analysis. This would circumvent the slow and costly route towards usage and testing that would normally occur through an FDA approved clinical trial setting. Furthermore, the device may also be used by healthy users as a potential means towards cognitive enhancement. 

IRENA: an Individually Recorded, Enhanced Neurological Assessment software suite 
In conjunction, we propose developing an online individually recorded, enhanced neurological assessment testing tool, IRENA, where individual user parameters, arising from headset usage, along with online cognitive assessments, will be uploaded and analyzed in real time by the user base. This would vastly enhance our ability to assess and improve the therapeutic value of the PIA MindSet. IRENA would give us the capability to 1) gauge efficacy on a vastly larger scale of participants than traditional paper-based assessment tests have done thus far 2) rapidly assess the efficacy of various parameters of the PIA MindSet in real-time and 3) more precisely identify which users are receiving the most therapeutic benefits, i.e. those suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus more extreme forms of dementias. 




Project Development 
To launch the development of the PIA MindSet and IRENA software, we need to establish an initial team of dedicated, full time software developers, hardware prototype fabricators, along with a team lead that would direct all areas of operation. To these ends, it may be useful to break down the Project into three main working groups: Interventions, Assessment and Analytics. Each will require their own particular skill sets to achieve a minimal viable product success for the overall Project. There will be considerable overlap with each working group of course, for example, validating primary scientific literature regarding assessment tests and interventions. The Interventions group would focus on designing and building a device that incorporates several interventions. Also developing the protocols for self-administering the interventions. Manufacturing and distribution will also be a key component of this working group.

The Assessment group would focus on software for the cognitive test. This will require assessing scientific literature and either using and adopting available cognitive tests, such as MiniCog, and/or developing news test that would function on either an iOS/Android smartphone, tablet and/or computer workstation. Another key goal of the assessments group is to have protocols in place that would mimic a trial study with controls and experimental groups that would be the best fit for this type of self administered device. Development of the “trial protocol” itself may involve considerable overlap with members' expertise among all three working groups.

The Analytics group will need to determine the best way to securely store and manage the data arriving from the self-assessment test (IRENA) and determine the best analytical tools to apply to tease out positive outcomes. This will help determine not only which multi-intervention combinations are effective, but also enable us to determine the minimal numbers of participants required to revisit any promising intervention for any future follow-up studies in a more traditional “gold standard” double-blinded clinical trial. If this approach works, it would have the profound effect of upending how standard clinical trials are designed in the future.

How Your Support Will Help us Fight Alzheimer’s Disease 

Your contributions will allow us to bring on additional team members and hasten the completion of our prototype, and —  if it is successful —  also help us make the resulting therapeutic hardware and software as affordable and easy to use as possible. Doing so will allow it to be maximally available to the public, and tee-up the ability to perform a first-in-kind decentralized clinical trial proving remediation of Alzhiemer’s. 

Such an outcome would be incredible not only for the patients themselves, but also for their loved ones and all of society, due to mitigating the vast socio-economic harm caused by such diseases. 

Furthermore, finally showing real progress against these diseases will go a long way towards convincing the public that we are at last in the game in terms of fighting age-related diseases generally, and help usher in a new age of support for healthy human longevity. Together we can do this. Thank You!

1760,rallyio-social-tokens-for-creators-musicians-stre,"Rally is building a Creator-driven network: open-sourced technology with community-first: economics, ownership and governance.


We’ve worked closely with creators (YouTubers, Tik-Tokers, Twitch streamers and more) who’ve built communities and content on multiple platforms to understand their goals, aspirations, and current challenges. We’ve witnessed first-hand the significant issues that creators face, including a lack of control in their fan relationships, bad economics and erratic policy changes. 


To address these needs, we’ll be applying Rally crypto’s core ethos of decentralization, self-sovereignty, and a token-economic model that will offer creators new opportunities to engage with their fans while earning new monetization streams to lessen their dependence on any individual social media platform.


With Rally, creators will be able to issue their own fully customizable, branded cryptocurrency called Creator Coins that represents their unique digital brand to provide value and utility to their fans. Creators will then have access to an easy-to-use blockchain toolkit powered by Creator Coins that enables them to create scarce collectibles and content, loyalty programs, and a healthy tokenized economy.


Most importantly, Rally will enable every creator to build a business model that will transcend any specific big-tech platform. This is no small feat, so we are looking for developers to help build an ecosystem of solutions for creators to turn their passions into careers - are you interested in helping?

286,one-million-developers-community-fund,"The One Million Developers initiative is focused on locating, organizing and empowering the next 1,000,000 Ethereum developers.

The Stewards are committed to reaching this audacious goal by the end of 2020, but we need your help!

How One Million Developers Works
Due to the nature of decentralization and distributed systems, it's difficult (perhaps impossible) to effectively grow and nurture all potential opportunities. Thus the One Million Developers initiative has taken the organizational structure of a do-ocracy.

We want to inspire and encourage others to find ways they can contribute to growth of the Ethereum community. Supporting them in their endeavors and experiments. The One Million Developer Stewards recognize we can not do this alone and it's will take a global village to achieve our dream of a vibrant and self-sustaining Ethereum community.

Radical transparency is core tenant of how we will operate.

Want to get involved? Not a problem! We will invite you in with open arms. 

How We Will Spend the Funds
The contributed funds will be dedicated entirely to supporting the projects and initiatives started under the One Million Developers umbrella. We want to support and connect with teams all around the world and help them however we can!

Example: https://nigeria.ethereum.network/

We are incredibly impressed with the work of Ayodeji Israel Awosika and the supporting team who have self activated and are now working towards onboarding between 1,000 to 2,000 new Ethereum developers in Nigeria. This is exact type of work we want to facilitate!

One Million Developers will put ALL FUNDS to supporting initiatives such as this.

NONE of the funds EVER will be used to pay core Contributors or Stewards. 

Projects Being Championed
We are currently in the active planning and seed planting stages. While, from the outside it may appear little activity is being accomplished, most of the work thus far has been to activate networks to prepare for a full launch in 2020.

We are very excited to share everything we are working in the upcoming weeks!

4213,blaine-bublitz-ethzk-infrastructure-ecosystem-dev,"Blaine Bublitz builds infrastructure for ETH/ZK application development. He also collaborates closely with the Dark Forest team and other 0xPARC-adjacent projects.
Blaine is a developer who is excited about web tech, open source, the future of decentralized virtual worlds, and ZK applications. He got hooked during the first public round of Dark Forest and has been building in the ZK application ecosystem ever since. Some of his work includes:

ZK Tooling and hardhat-circom

In collaboration with Jacob Rosenthal, Blaine helped to rewrite Dark Forest's zkSNARK build processes. This work was generalized into the hardhat-circom plugin, a configurable hardhat plugin which provides developers with a set of ZK circuit build tasks, and adds typescript declarations for snarkjs.

Using funding from GR13: Blaine updated hardhat-circom to be compatible with circom2 and added support for PLONK. Afterwards, he updated 0xPARC's circom-starter project to use circom2 and provide an example of PLONK generation.
Future improvements: Blaine wants to provide circuit testing infrastructure directly from hardhat-circom, so users don't need to try to integrate a separate tool, like circom_tester.

Contributions to circom & snarkjs

Blaine contributes to circom and snarkjs on a regular basis. He’s provided patches to reduce the bundle build by 50% and enabled WebWorker support.

Using funding from GR13: Blaine worked with another community member to ensure snarkjs could be used with circom2 output. He also fixed some breaking bugs in snarkjs dependencies and got all dependencies updated to the latest versions.
Future improvements: Blaine is currently working to add automated dependency upgrades, TypeScript declarations, and JavaScript bundler support to snarkjs.

Dark Forest Lobbies & Community Plugins

Blaine built infrastructure for Dark Forest players to write, share, and discover third-party Dark Forest plugins. He also wrote several particularly useful/popular plugins, including the Remote Miner, Map Export, and Artifactory.

He also built Dark Forest Lobbies while under a short contract. Now that Blaine has transitioned away from core development, he plans to expand on this new technique to allow people to spin up advanced custom lobbies. A prototype of scaffold-lobby is already available at https://github.com/projectsophon/scaffold-lobby.

Project Sophon

As one half of Project Sophon, Blaine open sources many experiments related to Dark Forest or other ZK ecosystem projects, such as darkforest-local, Broadcast market, and DF plugin-dev-server.

New stuff!

Blaine has some new projects coming up, including:

1) Some hardhat plugins to streamline crypto-native game development.
2) A crypto-native game starter kit.
3) A new crypto-native game that leverages the same ""lobby"" techniques as Dark Forest.

Gitcoin contributions will support Blaine's ongoing open-source work on ZK infrastructure, crypto-native gaming, and developer tools.

2073,crypto-commons-association-solarpunk-wow-event,"First things first, we’d like to thank everyone who supported us through Gitcoin Grants until now. Your help has been of great encouragement. Thank you for supporting the crypto commons! ❤️

This time we are taking part in Gitcoin Grants Round 14 to get support in making our ReFi event SolarPunk WOW a reality!

☀️ What is SolarPunk WOW?

We envision SolarPunk WOW as a hybrid event: unconference and hackathon at the same time. It is planned that the event will take place in October 2022 at the Crypto Commons Hub in Reichenau an der Rax, Austria. 

But let’s take a step back. 🚶

🏡 What is the Crypto Commons Hub?

The crypto commons hub is a physical house in the middle of the Austrian Alps. The CC Hub is envisioned as a warm, welcoming, and intellectually nurturing environment for digital nomads, artists, DAOs, and projects on retreat. As the first physical space exclusively dedicated to Crypto Commons, it serves to consolidate the theme and facilitate its ascendance as a popular counter-narrative under which progressive forces in crypto can rally.



☀️ Why SolarPunk WOW?

It’s time to make the CC Hub SolarPunk!

The general goal is to make the Hub more and more autonomous from the industrial system, producing our own electricity, food and technical infrastructures.

The event will consist of workshops and panels on regeneration and ReFi to foster the movement forward, and a hackathon to ideate and build SolarPunk tech in the Crypto Commons Hub!



To make the CC Hub SolarPunk we want to build:

🌱 A cyber-physical permaculture garden to feed the commoners! With IOT and efficient water collection/management systems (to be made in this area 👇).


🌱 A plastic recycling machine, with Precious Plastics. (https://preciousplastic.com/)

🌱 Solar panels with the aim of becoming 100% solar-powered, especially for our beloved hot tub.


🌱 PLUS whatever will emerge from the collective intelligence and creative joy of participants!

🔴 What is the Crypto Commons Association?
The Crypto Commons Association (CCA) is a non-profit organization founded in early 2021 to facilitate the development of digital common goods and infrastructure in the context of DLTs, their academic reception, and analysis, their public accessibility as well as their broad social application. It strives to reach its aims through the organization of events, the production of a full-feature documentary, and the operation of a permanent physical Hub-as-a-Commons.
Thank you very much for supporting us and our path to making the Crypto Commons Hub SolarPunk!

1691,b4h-awards-2020,"We are Blockchain for Humanity, an NGO that serves as a catalyst for Social Innovation.  Our mission is to support the use of emerging technologies and place it at the service of Humanity.  Through the annual b4H Awards, we identify and recognize use cases that have a valid use of Blockchain technology. 

Through the Awards, we have been able to recognize the efforts of social entrepreneurs and support their goals towards innovating and developing solutions that aim at addressing gaps in society and the environment.

Now you can support our awardees with your Gitcoin Contribution



B4H Awards
The awards started out as a means to identify projects using the blockchain technology for social and environmental impact. We simply identify legitimate Use Cases that clearly justify the use of Blockchain Technology and offer a clear solution to a known problem. Awards seek a HIGHER PURPOSE and a SOUND BUSINESS MODEL. Every day, remarkable social entrepreneurs are set out to address a problem they are very close to. It is for them that we persist in offering these awards and recognize their journey.

The awardees become part of the b4H community and network, which offers an important support for early stage startups. Every year, b4H takes notice of trending use cases and gains a better understanding of the problems social entrepreneurs are trying to solve. b4H is now entering in the 4th consecutive edition of the awards, totalling an aggregated amount of 135 applications. Our team is proud of being involved in the review and selection process of 20 awardees since 2017. EthicHub, PolloPollo, ETHKids, Tykn and BanQu are some of the most relevant success stories among our awardees.

We, at b4H, mentor our awardees in business and technical areas, promote them within our b4H networks, and help them with their fundraising efforts. For this reason, we kindly invite you to be part of our supporting community by contributing to this grant aimed to support the next batch of recipients of the b4H 2020 Awards. Any means of financial support would make a big difference for early stage startups looking to validate their concept and complete their next milestone in their development. 

#b4H2020Awards

Judges from our B4H Community have already selected from all the nominees the top projects for our two, different categories, shapers and dreamers.

Dreamers are projects that have demonstrated a valuable use case for a known problem, while their solutions are not fully validated and in some cases lack user adoption, they are inspired and driven by their strong and promising vision.

Shapers instead have already gained a level of business maturity, they have gone through adjustments to their business model, their positive impact is unquestionable and their user adoption is well on track. For us the Shapers are role models, they are social entrepreneurs driven by a higher purpose so they deserve our recognition.



While the winners for the Shapers Category are:
- TraceRx
- Trustlines protocol
- DADA’s Invisible Economy

Those to which the collected founds are going to be addressed are the winners of the Dreamers category, as we consider these are the projects that do need an extra push from our community. Those winners are:

- Bitcoin Beach
- DistributedTown
- Wikibank


Thanks in advance for your contribution! Let's improve our Humanity with Blockchain all together!

The lessor provides the liquidity of lease assets for the Protocol, and Protocol will generate a lease order and broadcast it to the Mesh Network of 0x, that's easy to sell on multiple DEXs.

The lessee can borrow interesting assets on the multiple DEXs.

When the lessee begins the lease:
The lessee deposits a certain amount of cash pledge and rents into the Protocol. Then Protocol will transfer them to the decentralized bank (Compound/MakerDAO) to earn interest.
Also, the Protocol mint the ERC721 Token of the lease contract, and the lessor can trade on Asset Market.

When the lessee returns the assets, then Protocol executes the following actions:
Return cash pledge and remaining rent to the lessee.
Transfer the rent to the lessor.
The lessee gets the reward from earning interest.

About roles in Protocol
Lessor
The lessor provides the assets for the lessee and earns rent.

Lessee
The lessee borrows the assets from the lessor and pays the rent to the lessor.

DEFI/Bank
The Protocol can earn additional interest at the bank of Compound/MakerDAO.

Asset Market
The user can exchange the asset to another asset; for example, SpiderDEX/Opensea can sell the ERC721 of lease contract that helps the user to reduce risk.

Ignorable Extra Ideas
Peer-To-Peer Lease => ERC721 Contract => Contract Loan => Insurance
Peer-To-Peer Lease => ERC721 Contract => Earn Real-Time-Rent

Loan
The lease contract consists of cash deposit and rents as security so that the third party can provide the service of loan because the rent can be calculated and get in the expected period

Insurance
The loan may default, and the lease contract isn't completed. However, the insurance can provide the currency immediately that waits for the lease contract to be finished or liquidated.

Earn Rent
They can earn fees from the lessor wants to get money of rent every second/minute/hour that provides service that waits for the finished of the lease contract.

3523,archival-of-the-ethereum-blockchain-for-10000-yea,"Ethereum's stated goal is to be resilient against catastrophic events and be able to survive World War 3. Part of this resiliency relies on the ability to easily reconstruct the entirety of the Ethereum blockchain using decentralized peer-to-peer sharing.

The retrieval of information, however, still requires nodes to be kept online or blockchain data to be available upon request, both of which may prove to be a central point of failure if there is no electrical power or if access to the high-speed internet is limited. Ultimately, there should be a way to store all the data contained in the Ethereum blockchain in a storage medium that does not require expensive equipment and specific storage conditions. Additionally, it must be possible to easily duplicate archival data in a cost-effective manner.

We believe that long-term storage of digital data in DNA solves the following problems:

Data density: the data density of DNA is close to 1 exabyte (10^18 bytes) per cubic centimeter, meaning that a few milligrams of DNA could store the entirety of the Ethereum blockchain.
Future proofness: while most storage mediums rely on technology that may become outdated in the next decades, DNA data retrieval is based on DNA sequencing technologies that will likely continue to be an important aspect of clinical research in the future (that is, unless our future selves are not made out of DNA anymore...)
Storage lifetime: DNA has been successfully recovered from frozen fossils that were thousands of years old, suggesting that digital data stored in DNA under the appropriate conditions (ie. less than -80C) could be preserved for much longer than that.
Data replication: DNA storage encodes information into millions of single-stranded DNA oligomers pooled in a single test tube. It is trivial to generate copies of the encoded information by simply performing Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on a small aliquot of the original oligo pool (less than 0.1% is needed). The cost to replicate an entire oligo pool is less than $10 and the whole process takes about 1h.


Table 1. Comparison between baseline memory technologies and projected DNA memory. Source: Zhirnov, V., Zadegan, R., Sandhu, G. et al. Nucleic acid memory. Nature Mater 15, 366–370 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/nmat4594

While the idea of storing digital information in DNA may seem outlandish at first, DNA storage has enormous potential in terms of storage density and retention time (Table 1). Furthermore, the process of encoding information into DNA is fairly straightforward (Fig. 1). First, binary information is converted into DNA nucleotides (G,A,T,C) and each nucleotide sequence is synthesized as single-stranded DNA oligomers using conventional DNA synthesis techniques. Up to 1 million of these oligomers are pooled together into a single test tube and these oligo pools are either lyophilized or encapsulated in silica for long-term storage. Data recovery is performed by reading the sequence of these oligo pools using next-generation sequencing technologies (ie. the retrieval process uses the same instruments that are currently used to sequence human genomes).

Several academic groups have demonstrated the storage of digital information of increasing complexity in DNA [1]. Yet, most DNA recovery methods were plagued by a relatively high error-rate, which limited the effectiveness of DNA storage methods. Recently, researchers have effectively solved this problem by implementing Reed-Solomon [2] error correction encoding to DNA digital data, which effectively enables the recovery of information in an error-free manner despite sample degradation[3]. The work by Meiser et al. solved one of the last problems associated with DNA storage, thereby ensuring that the long-term storage of information in DNA is perhaps the only storage media that can last thousands of years [4]. 

Project Deliverables

This grant will provide funds to the Lambert Lab for the proof-of-concept development of a workflow for the synthesis, storage, retrieval, and easy-dissemination of data from the Ethereum blockchain using DNA. We will follow the recently published protocol by Meiser et al. from the Glass group [5] to encode, store, and retrieve data from the Ethereum blockchain.

Since the synthesis of the entirety of the Ethereum blockchain is still cost-prohibitive, the project will reach the following milestones, in order of complexity/cost: 

Storage of:

 Single block header: 929 byte (96 DNA sequences)
 Complete block (including transactions): 77 kB (4096 DNA sequences)
 Genesis block (genesis.json)
 All Cryptopunks: 830kB [6] (62360 DNA sequences)
 Stateless block witness: ~1-2MB [7, 8]
 Complete history of a single account or smart contract. 
 Data from the Eth2.0 deposit smart contract. 
 Bridge contract transactions (Optimism, Arbitrum, Polyscan, Ronin, etc)
 Complete NFT collection (eg. Artblocks project)
 Code for Ethereum clients (Geth, Erigon, Nethermind, Prysm, Lighthouse, Teku, Numbus)
 Continuous blocks: 30kB * N, with N>10,000
 Full pruned Blockchain: 200GB
 Archival Node: >1TB

The storage of any other blockchain-related data (eg. specific blocks, NFT, merkle tree, smart contract, etc.) will also be synthesized as lyophilized DNA upon request.

Methods

DNA synthesis will be performed using commercially available services such as the 12K and 90K oligo ""chips"" from Genscript (Twist Bioscience may also be used for pools requiring more than 1M oligos). A few example datasets, and their DNA encoding, are included on this project's Github: https://github.com/lambert-lab/eth-DNA-storage [9]. Specifically, I have posted the DNA encoding for a Block Header (96 DNA sequences), a Block Header with transaction data (1024 DNA sequences), the complete data for a single Block (4096 DNA sequences), and all Crypto Punks (from png image, 62360 DNA sequences).

DNA amplification and purification, DNA stabilization and immobilization, and DNA sequencing and analysis will be performed in the Lambert Lab. Amplification from the encoded oligo pool will be carried out using a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) that uses a high-fidelity DNA polymerase and a protocol optimized for short target amplification [10].

DNA samples will either be lyophilized in a trehalose solution (half-life >1 year at room temperature [11]) or immobilized in silica particles (stability >2000 years at 9.4C [2]). Long term stability will be assayed using the technique developed by Organick et al. that leverages the Arrhenius equation and quantitative PCR to extract DNA lifetimes [11].

Sequencing of small datasets (<1MB) will be performed on an Illumina iSeq 100 already in Dr. Lambert's laboratory. Sequencing of larger datasets will be performed on a Nextseq 2000 or HiSeq from the Cornell Institute of Biotechnology.

2604,livestream-nft-minting-videodac,"Summary

Livestream NFT Minting is a project by videoDAC, building on top of Livepeer.

The objective of the project is to enable NFTs to be minted in real-time, from livestream video being processed by Livepeer's ""Broadcaster"" functionality.

The project aims to build on top of Livepeer, use a Layer 2 on Ethereum for minting, and use Swarm or IPFS/Filecoin for storage.

Concept

Enable creators of livestreaming content to automatically mint NFTs of video content they are streaming.

Proposed Implementation

Livepeer's ""Broadcaster"" is a simple livestreaming server.

It receives livestream video as `rtmp`, and serves livestream video as `hls`:



When converting `rtmp` into `hls`, the Broadcaster creates a sequence of ""segments"" of video content.

Each `.ts` ""segment"" is around 2 seconds long, and exists for around 10-12 seconds before being gc'd:



This project aims to add functionality to Livepeer's ""Broadcaster"" to allow these segments of video to be:

a) stored to a decentralised storage network (IPFS/Filecoin or Swarm)

b) minted as NFTs on a Layer 2.

This would enable automated minting of livestream videos as NFTs when livestreaming using a Livepeer ""Broadcaster"" with this feature enabled.

The good news is that Livepeer ""Broadcaster"" already has a signing key built in, to be able to connect to Ethereum.

What is Livepeer?

Livepeer is a protocol, a live mainnet, a staking token, an open-source software suite, and the video layer of web3 stack, on Ethereum.

The delegated-Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) protocol, launched in May 2018, provides inflation-funding mechanisms to reward for continuous participation in the network.

The mainnet is a production transcoding network, where nodes receive source video, and transcode live video (""resize it"" / ""squash it"") into ""more accessible"" formats, in sub-real-time, in exchange for streaming fees in ETH.

The staking token is Livepeer Token (LPT), which can be used to curate nodes on the live mainnet, and receive a share of their fees and rewards. This can be done by connecting your wallet to Livepeer's Protocol Explorer.

The open-source software suite is available on Livepeer's Github page, containing stuff for people who like Solidity, golang, javascript, typescript and C.",https://github.com/videoDAC/Livestream-NFT-Minting,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,https://github.com/criticaltv,1

2768,digital-assets-succession-comprehensive-research-,"Faith Obafemi is a lawyer based in Lagos and has been active in the blockchain space since 2017, working with various projects in different capacities. Some of her top research works include curating a Starter Kit for lawyers interested in starting a career in blockchain. This starter kit has been accessed by thousands of lawyers and once recommended by Katherine Wu. Another, published as the cover article for that Issue on Legal Business World: ‘Opportunities in the Blockchain Industry for Lawyers’, is a favourite for many lawyers starting their decentralized journey.

More about her story in this Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/FaithObafemiEsq/status/1397234922650324994.

She recently presented on 'Decentralized Governance: The Future of Global Cooperation?' at the 10th Annual Cambridge International Law Conference, which was held online 18-20 March 2021. You can access the extended abstract here.

Her proposal, for research exploring the possibilities of having smart contracts and cryptocurrency as the legal and monetary engine for Space, was accepted into the 2021 Tony Blair Institute Fellowship program. She will be working on that over the next six months.

For 2021/2022, Faith would like to take on comprehensive research on Digital Assets Succession, exploring the business, technical and legal aspects involved. In our increasingly digital lives, we generate digital assets daily. What happens to these digital assets when we are no longer here? Recent research is mostly geared towards digital assets like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and other social media profiles. Digital assets now have values that rival conventional physical ones, and this is not limited to the popular and volatile cryptocurrencies or the latest NFTs. Proposed title: “Succession Planning for Digital Assets By Individuals and Corporate: A Business, Technical, and Legal Perspective”.

This research affects all stakeholders in the blockchain and crypto ecosystem, from token holders to core developers, node operators and even investors. The concluding research report may also result in a product to meet this need as recently expressed by Daniel Rollingher in a tweet: https://twitter.com/DBRolling/status/1388168949171322880.

Also, through the Blockchain Law Questions Podcast, Faith and her co-host Sylvia, would like to provide a platform for everyone to join the chat on the much-needed conversations on issues and news around blockchain and law.

Growing capable Human Agents through Education + Entertainment + Enterprise organised through Community 

WHAT IS ""AGENCY""?
Agency is a creative community DAO that supports every member across time and space to deliver powerfully and consistently. Whatever your need, we help you rise to it.

Our noble cause rests on the mountains of collective experience by the early members collected in running festDAO and being part of the DAOstack stream of collective action since its inception. 

We base our activity on these principles:

EARN AS YOU LEARN

Use the Agency Methodology exercises to improve your followthrough and  earn you Reputation and Currency via a DAOstack DAO. We nerd out over incentivizing people to become better and we find your weak strengths (no pun) collectively - if you want to.

WE CREATE MEDIA

Our agents (all of us!) are behind content already. We'll use them to fund the DAO and its creators. Join us and create some more! This DAO runs on Creative Fusion. Humans are its hydrogen and together we create create create.

COMMUNITY OWNED

Funds offered to this grant go straight to the community that is driving the future of the DAO. These funds will be community governed once the DAOStack deployment is complete. 

HOW CAN THE ECOSYSTEM BENEFIT?

Agency aims to help Ethereum and web3 as a whole to see itself as a movement - a social, cultural, economical and political movement - and to tell its story in 360 degrees PoV. The content we produce is the mental on-ramp for absolute newcomers who get to follow a method that opens body mind and soul to the decentralized and value-driven paradigm that connects our community. The already forged cryptonatives get practices and a peer group to grow through, learn and find their niche to grow in as persons and active decentralizers, whether as entrepreneurs or service providers.
Think of a Mastermind DAO that maximized individual benefit by aligning their goals with the community goals through process and method.

We bring:
powerful and far-reaching storytelling and craft to web3 communities as a service
A strong mentoring and personal growth network to incubate the next generation of entrepreneurs and creators in the cryptosphere
Solidify value-alignment between DAO clients and DAO members

3986,know-the-blocks-maven,"KNOW THE BLOCKS MAVEN (KBM) is an Educational Consult passionate about educating and training young adults and children with Special Needs about the Blockchain ecosystem. The project was commenced on July 2021. We are taking steps in integrating the blockchain educational curriculum into the formal education system so as to foster early adaptation and involvement in the blockchain ecosystem thereby caving unique career paths for children that will eventually mature into experts.
No solution comes with the product first in mind. Here, we present our findings and thought processes that lead us to our solution, KBM. 

OUR STRATEGY
We create a process of integration by directly engaging formal education systems (High Schools) and Special Needs Centers through the establishing of Blockchain clubs thereby promoting awareness and longing for more knowledge about the Blockchain. This will generate a high influx of inquisitive minds into the KBM hub to get intensive education about Blockchain and Web3.
We aim to build an educational hub where Blockchain education for young adults and children with special needs can have access to top-notch information and education about the Blockchain Ecosystem. 
Partnering with other gaming and metaverse projects like AloT Metaversity so as to encourage and promote fun education as young minds might tend to get bored easily with the traditional way of learning.  
 
Our core strengths and values are;
· 	imparting knowledge to early teens and youth by integrating and familiarizing them with the Blockchain Ecosystem with world-class training both onsite & online with a top-notch educational curriculum.
·  	cohort-based collaborative learning which helps people learn faster where self-learners also have access to shared environments to practice their skills, grow in a community of like minds to enhance creativity and foster lifelong friendships in the ecosystem.
·   giving learners all the basic tools in the blockchain space will help them in gaining a competitive edge in the blockchain career niche.
·   A team of tutors that are well trained, certified, experienced professionals in the education and blockchain ecosystem.
 
Our vision for this project is born out of 
·        passion for creating an early adaptive community for young users of blockchain technology at the lowest educational level possible which will further promote interest in making a career and in turn, solve the enormous challenge of unemployment in Nigeria and Africa at large.
·        To solve the challenge of miss-conception and give accurate information about Blockchain technology in Nigeria at the lowest educational level possible. Statistics has shown that ninety per cent out of a Hundred when asked ""what do you know about the blockchain"" will mention cryptocurrency, that is the Bitcoin and Ethereum as the technology itself is perceived to be a direct synonym to crypto. This is the gap we intend to bridge in Nigeria and Africa at large. PARTICIPATIVE EDUCATIVE INFORMATION. Blockchain is a database system hence, its numerous application to other major sectors of the world like healthcare, real estate, governance etc. is becoming widely accepted in the world and Africa has to gradually wake up to this reality. Its importance in the next decade cannot be overemphasized. Having BASIC BLOCKCHAIN EDUCATION in schools will enhance and promote participation in the ecosystem.
·        Understand what'd be an easy way for young adults, children with special needs to listen, understand and engage in the Blockchain ecosystem and Web3.
·        Explore Basic Elements of Blockchain Literacy and Web3 for Children and Young Adult Learners and create an early adoptive community in schools by establishing blockchain clubs.

CHALLENGES 
There is a lack of adequate basic information about the blockchain at the educational grassroots level.
 
Current information about the Blockchain Ecosystem is half baked and inadequately explored.
 
Lack of opportunity given to Special Needs Children and Young Adults to explore and make a career from the Blockchain ecosystem.
 
The inability of our traditional education system to create this choice of engagement to other ecosystems with the blockchain inclusive.

Progress Chart
We are strongly confident that by the first quarter of 2022, we would have established ten blockchain clubs in the major high schools in Abuja, Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria and increase to twenty by the third quarter. By the end of the year, we would have increased the number of full functional blockchain clubs in high schools to not less than thirty and a thriving community of not less than five hundred young adults making lifelong friendships that fosters progress and growth in the blockchain ecosystem.

Our Limitations.
Setting up a standard and comfortable space for training and learning that will bring quality knowledge to our current and prospective students.
Raising funds to achieve our core objectives as the largest population of African still feed on hand to mouth, thereby making it hard to patronize Knowledge if it comes with a price tag.
Motivation is on a very low tone as we are forced to push and pay for whatever feet are needed to achieve alone.
Modern gadgets and equipment for learning are needed to comfortably and easily impact knowledge to our students.


Needs
Monetary aid to rent a training facility that can accommodate at least thirty students at a time as the one we currently have can accommodate only a little over five persons.
Monetary aid for training equipment and gadgets such as laptops,  projecting screens, virtual glasses, tables and chairs etc.
More educational resources.

# Summary

We strongly believe in giving back personal data to the individuals it belongs to. By making compute-to-SSI possible, we will enable algorithms to learn from data stored in SSI wallets, without violating privacy.


# Description

While personal data being protected and governed with SSI wallets can guarantee privacy of that data, currently A.I. algorithms are not able to learn from it. This is a large barrier for adoption. Furthermore we find that the companies that do want to share data using Self Sovereign Identity, prefer to keep their own copy. In some cases like governments this is a necessity, however in many situations it is not.

If private personal data would only exist in SSI wallets, using Compute-To-SSI would enable companies not only to benefit from reduced GDPR risk, it would allow them to learn from this personal data without having to possess it.

Historically, enterprises are very hesitant to share data with other companies, due to privacy concerns and ultimately losing their competitive advantage. This cripples their ability to train an accurate A.I. and gather valuable insights. Besides machine learning algorithms still being able to learn from the data given back to the individual, it could also learn from the data provided by other companies/entities. A Compute-To-SSI mechanism could enable a data driven revolution, as it would grant access to an enormous decentralized pool of data to learn from. By doing so, this will greatly increase the accuracy of these algorithms.

We feel this technology has the potential to let people and organizations benefit from Artificial Intelligence models, which are now exclusively available to tech giants.

At WorkPi we are building a decentralized Internet of Jobs, and provide a SaaS solution to enterprises to assess and educate their employees. By doing so, we are creating one of the many valuable use cases that will be enabled by the compute-to-SSI model. After all, besides skills & education information, there are many other types of data that a person can add to their personal data wallet (e.g. health, wearable, cookies, identity or finance data).

We strongly believe in giving back personal data to the individuals it belongs to. We see this as a win-win for both the individual as well as the companies and the key to both fair economic and personal success. However, at this point the problem remains how to learn from this private data.

The module that we will be creating, will be used on the WorkPi platform as a first use case. However this solution has the ability to change the world. Therefore, we want to opensource this technology, to enable everyone to use this technique to improve individual privacy and make insights now exclusively available to tech giants publicly available. Workpi will be amongst the first companies to use this for career related data.

2952,aggadom-web3-infrastructure-for-passion-economy-a,"Aggadom's mission is to make Passion Economy a reality. To serve humanity, by providing a decentralized infrastructure that allows passions, social engagements and creativity be truly rewarding.
 
How? 

By creating Non-Fungible-Bond as a new type of a digital asset. Such bond makes collaboration, composability and business models easy and natural for projects and lets them to focus on what is important.

This bond represents a unique verifiable engagement between an individual and the NFT, which is not ownership. Using our novel economic model these engagements are financially beneficial to both the individual and the NFT owner. This unlocks the potential of building new types of strong and engaged communities, as an alternative way to experience NFTs.
Using our passion, experience, KERNEL Web3 philosophy foundation, extensive research of the human psychology and Web3 ecosystem, we have found a way to translate this passion economy slogan into smart contracts.

We are developing a public good open source project as the infrastructure that will enable individuals to focus on what they are passionate to create. This infrastructure allows to build hierarchically composable economic structures that unlock the power of collaborative and composable creativity.

The Value: 

	For the art fan / NFT investor 
don't just Like, don't just buy - make a long lasting impact by investing in the artist
get an exclusive access to NFT Content and Art Experiences, be part of a like-minded community
enjoy high and continuous ROI from your investment in NFTs
all that with on-chain assets, but without buying the NFT ownership
0% fees

	For the Artist 
get the Likes that truly support and enable you
earn from being creative without losing ownership of your art
supportive fan community, personally invested in your creativity
built-in promotion incentives
0% fees

	For the platforms developers
Ready to use Business Model as an Infrastructure
Steady income from the platform directly correlated to the number of engagements
0% fees

Aggadom is designed to be a sustainable project, one that charges 0% fees from the individuals that make it valuable.
How? Magic! We support anyone following their passion and this is magical ;) 
 


Background
Aggadom's economic model was born in 2010. It was intended to be the business model for Aerogroove, at that time a rising EDM music platform that aimed to promote EDM artists, which was co-founded by two of Aggadom's founders.
Unfortunately for thousands of Aerogroove fans and the founding team, the implementation of that model was not possible using the financial technology available at that time. Without the resources to maintain this project, in 2017, after 11 years of serving EDM fans all over the world with great music, Aerogroove was shut down.
Check it out on Wayback machine.

Blockchain technology, and Ethereum L2 in particular, made the implementation of this model possible not only for Aerogroove, but as an infrastructure for a wide range of applications to be developed on top of it. 

We are excited to announce that thanks to Web3 and NFTs, Aerogroove is going to be resurrected as a Web3 Composable Music Platform powered by Aggadom!

We are a team of three experienced individuals working full time on the project.
Working on the PoC, the whitepaper, and Aerogroove as a show case for a platform powered by Aggadom.
We invite individuals who share our passion to join us in making this a reality.

2032,colorado-os,"Colorado OS began as an ETHDenver 2021 & ColoradoJam buildathon project. Initially, it delivers a series of decentralized license registries on Web3 but the bigger vision is a Web3 based operating system that can be used by states (or other organizational bodies) to manage a host of other processes and functions. 

The proof of concept shows how a digital gaming license (NFT) can be issued to players that enables them to engage with a special set of not-for-profit Web3 games of chance.  Another example we put together for ETHDenver shows how a digital parks pass (NFT) can be issued on Web3 that allows the licensing party to immediately begin earning interest on parks donations by opening a DeFi position on Compound.Finance. 

Colorado-OS won an impact bounty at ETHDenver 2021 and took first place for the digital licensing solution at ColoradoJam. All Gitcoin grants donations will be used for further development of Colorado-OS. Specifically, we're interested in exploring and implementing an integration with MyColorado into the application.

Communities are the main entrance to the ecosystem and where we learn, discuss points of view, study new projects, share news. The platform seeks to facilitate finding communities based on relevant characteristics.


v1. We have just launched the first platform version (very simple) that allows to:
Search communities by topic, name, region, language, etc.
Explore the communities by viewing their description and accessing their main channels.
Add a community

Features v1.1
As the platform gain sufficient volume and diversity of communities, the idea is to provide an interface that allows discovering communities by vertical: theme (NFT, Defi, etc), network (ethereum, polkadot, solana, polygon, etc), project (PoH, POAP, Kleros, etc), others
Community/Project landing page to provide a better space for the communities to share  their mission in detail, contact channels, implemented with web3. 

Features v2
Integrate donation to the community functionality.
Web3 user, create profile and follow communities to facilitate community curation and discovery.

Experimentation
Decentralized curated registries present a challenge that is being addressed with a variety of approaches. We want to contribute to this experimentation, designing and testing new mechanisms.
The community registration process requires approval to avoid pormoting or making accesible communities that seek to defraud users.
Currently this authorization is centralized, but we want to decentralize that registry. 
For that, we  want to experiment with different ideas, one of those ideas is to deliver a governance Token to each community listed on the platform, a token to be used in the voting process against appeals.The mechanism will be optimistic, that is, it will not require a vote for approval (this will be delegated), but in the face of an appeal for rejection of approval or an approval considered that does not meet the requirements by the community, a voting proposal will be submitted.

The Grants obtained will be destined to:
UI improvements and development of the functionaliies listed above.

Funcionalidades v2
Integrar la posibilidad de donar directamente a la comunidad a través de billetera.
Creación de usuario web3, seguir comunidades para facilitar la curaduría y descubrimiento de comunidades.


Experimentación
Los registros curados descentralizados presentan un desafío que está siendo abordado con diversos enfoques. Queremos aportar a esa experimentación, diseñando y testeando nuevos mecanismos.. 
El proceso de registro de una comunidad requiere una aprobación para evitar comunidades que buscan defraudar a los usuarios. 
En un principio esa autorización es centralizada, pero queremos descentralizar ese registro. Para eso proponemos entregar un Token de gobernanza a cada comunidad listada en la plataforma, token a ser utilizado en proceso de votación frente a apelaciones. 
El mecanismo será optimista, es decir no requerirá voto para la aprobación (esto estará delegado), pero frente a una apelación por rechazo de aprobación o una aprobación considerada que no cumple los requisitos por parte de la comunidad se someterá voto.

Las Grants obtenidos serán destinadas a:

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

Ask someone outside of the tech world to define Crypto Currency or the Blockchain and it is very likely that you will be met with silence, or a very vague answer at best.

Ask someone within the tech world to explain the Decentralized Web and the first words you hear may be ""On January 1st, 1970...""

Block Bot strives to stay true to the course Einstein set forth. To ensure things stayed simple I enlisted an expert. My four year old daughter.

A pun filled, quirky story soon developed which centered around a robot's very eventful first night of employment. One where multiple problems befall him, luckily, all can be solved with the concepts that you find with the Decentralized Web.

An investment in knowledge
always pays the best interest.
* Benjamin Franklin

This is where I must ask for your help.

The story as it is now will do nothing to help people understand the new web. Too juvenile for adults and lacking excitement for the younger generation, any attempt to treat the story alone as something serious would result in a status quo.

If funded, I will build a game around the story. Everything that was static will become animated, every question that was answered will become a challenge to be solved. Eyes that would skim through the story will now be focused on engaged; making sure the hash matches what was found next to the wallet.

Radio buttons and checkboxes will be absent, preventing users from guessing their way through. Instead, users will use the Scratch Programming Language to create their own, unique solutions to the problems presented.

The Ethereum test network will be used to solve puzzles, share play through experiences to social media, send friends digital items, chat with another player who is online, and quite possibly a few other options will pop up.

To allow the young users to remain positive a sliding difficulty level will be implemented. A player may have to restart a level, but they should never feel ""stuck"". Finishing the story will be challenging, not hard or obnoxious.

A sample of what players will have an understanding of upon completion of the game is what it means to be Decentralized, how and why Blockchain works, the nuances of tokens, transactions, fees, and gas. Plus they will have been introduced to the basic rules of web programming.

Who We Are

As Ethereum pushes the limits on decentralization from both a technology and community perspective. The Cat Herders work to fill in the gaps of areas that do not have enough coordination in the ecosystem. Additionally, ECH provides a great on-ramp for those who want to get involved in the Ethereum community, but may not be technical or know where to start.

Ethereum Cat Herders is a group of individuals, working together to support the Ethereum core developers and the larger Ethereum ecosystem with research, project management and other aspects of communication and coordination. A mid-year summary report of tasks performed in 2021 is published as The Ethereum Cat Herders mid-year report (Q2-Q3, 2021).

The main tasks the group has performed are:
EIP awareness and consensus building
Creating & curating educational content 
Collecting information through surveys & documenting meetings
Community building
Identifying potentially needed support for client & tools
Continuous process improvement

What do we do?

Creating & curating educational content 
EIPs are the building blocks of Ethereum's main network. ECH is leading the EIPIP meetings and contributes to the process improvement, process awareness, and also by helping the EIP editors and substantially decreasing the open pull requests in the EIP repo. 

PEEP an EIP - A video series focused on EIPs & ERCs. An initiative by the Herder-in-Chief to familiarize with upcoming proposals & existing standards. Over 35 episodes have been recorded and published, including multiple episodes with Vitalik and overviews of every EIP included in Ethereum network upgrades. 

Design an updated EIP bot 
Encouraged devs and best minds to become EIP editors to help move the EIPIP proposal into the next status of the standardization process.

Community meetings 
Conducting our own research, we identify potentially “contentious” proposals that need open communication channels between client developers and other communities (such as general users or miners). We organized and facilitated EIP specific community calls for:

Ethereum Berlin upgrade countdown community call — announcement & recording
EIP-1559 invited participants from all sides of the proposal, researchers, client devs, miners, EIP editors, authors & champions. 
EIP-3074 invited co-authors, infrastructure providers and client devs to familiarize them with the proposal and helped get them prepared for the London upgrade.
For most of the proposals under discussion, resources are curated and made available on the EIP resources on the ECH website.

Community building
With the help of an increasingly social media reach, ECH is heavily investing in community building. We recently upgraded the ECH website with a much more user-friendly and engaging layout.

Event facilitation & participation 
Participation in various blockchain events & webinars to talk about the EIP process, network upgrade processes & proposals to expect in 2021.
The Future of Ethereum 1.0 in 2021 at ETHDenver,
EEA educational series of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance
Facilitate Ethereum speakers for blockchain events.

yAcademy grows to 5 permanent contributors covering various roles: auditing, process, ops/comms, technical content

Update November 2021: yAcademy pilot program has been successfully run

Update Sept 2021: the first pilot fellowship (aka internships) program is scheduled to start Sept 15th 2021, hosting 8 fellows, 4 guest auditors, and a selection of guest speakers at weekly events throughout the program. The pilot program is 4 weeks, 1 codebase to audit per week. yAcademy has also ramped up its online presence, built a community of incredible contributors in the ops/comms departments. All funds from this Gitcoin grant will go towards supporting these contributors for all upcoming matching rounds till yAcademy is able to stand on its own feet.

Update Mar 2021: yAcademy participates in the KERNEL B2 fellowship program, organizes twosessions during the amazing KERNEL B2 fellowship program delivered by storm0x from Yearn Finance.

Update Nov 15 2020: incentive structure designed, the yAcademy proposal passed with 99.99% support, a partnership between Yearn, Gitcoin and Status. Signups for the first fellowship round is open

====================================


Articles for the general public:
Update Mar 2021: new article ""Layer-2 for Beginners"" 
Periodical articles for the general public to unpack technical topics. The next article is about a framework for understanding and evaluating layer-2 solutions.


GASETH price feed on UMA to facilitate gas options/futures products as an alternative to gas mining: 
Update Nov 1st 2020: UMPI-16 passes the vote, the first DeFi product to use it is underway by uLABS.

Governance-free access to credit via in-protocol tokenization of gas: 
This is the first in a series of research posts aimed at creating a market-based solution to the gas price volatility. As a side benefit, it also enables a public option for essential financial utilities like access to credit.

ETH2 development: 
An optimal algorithm to tally up validator attestations. I will be implementing it in Trinity first, then Go for Prysm client.

Rent-free stablecoin AMM on yEarn: 
Stablecoin exchange is one of the most widely used services on Ethereum. This proposal advocates for rent-free and governance-minimized stablecoin-optimized AMM. There is an overwhelming community support for this, and work on it is ongoing.

yEarn strategy for ETH and YFI long-term holders
This strategy is intended for those long both assets. The initial response has been positive. Currently doing simulation and backtesting to compare this strategy against simply hodling both assets.

555,loan-shark,"Loan Shark is an NFT leasing marketplace, enabling trustless & secure lending and borrowing of NFTs where you stream the payment by the second. 

We are heavily involved in the NFT space and believe there exists the need for NFT collectors to be able to trustlessly lease their hard-earned NFTs to those willing to leverage the utility and prowess which they hold within.

Imagine getting to the final level of a game and needing a badass weapon. Not being able to afford it, you should be able to rent the item for a set period of time e.g. 1 hour to play and complete the game!

Imagine an avid CryptoArt collector who has amassed a collection from the dopest crypto artists in the space. Then take a CryptoVoxels / Decentraland / MetaVerse landlord looking for some killer artworks to use in the opening of a new plot. Well, now the collector can safely lend their NFT for, say, 7 days at a set price knowing that at the end, the artwork is safe and sound back in their wallet.

What it Does
LoanShark blends NFTs with DeFi in the form of streamed payments powered by the Sablier protocol. https://www.sablier.finance

LoanShark is a lease marketplace that can wrap any standard ERC721 NFT, proxying through all methods of the original NFT as well as enabling a payment stream between the lender and the borrower.

The NFT looks, tastes and smells like the original. However, it is encased within the LoanShark contract which has the power to always “return” the NFT back to the owner and which will facilitate the payment between the two parties involved.

3059,toucan-protocol-carbon-as-a-money-lego,"👋 We're Toucan
At Toucan we're kickstarting a climate finance ecosystem in Web3 to make DeFi work for the planet.
We've launched the Toucan Protocol, which introduces a new building block to DeFi: programmable carbon credits. With carbon as a money lego, we're enabling an ecosystems of dApps and protocols to embed climate action into their code.
We aim to drive capital to planet-positive projects by unlocking carbon as an asset class and building block in Web3 🌳

🏗 What we're building
Carbon Bridge: A generalized bridge that allows anybody to bring carbon credits on-chain from any source. After carbon credits have been verifiably retired (locked) in legacy registries like Verra, offsetting projects or credit owners alike can mint their credits as ERC20 tokens, called TCO2.
Carbon Pools: Based on shared attributes, Carbon Pools create a carbon reference token backed by a basket of TCO2 carbon credits tokenized via the Carbon Bridge. By creating carbon reference pools, we can aggregate credits and create a liquid new carbon primitive for DeFi. We've launched our first pool, the Based Carbon Pool, which backs BCT, the Base Carbon Tonne.
Carbon Burning. Our goal is to connect capital with climate-positive projects by leveraging public blockchains and to democratize access to the asset class. This means empowering people to buy, sell and hold active carbon credits. The ultimate aim, though, is to remove those credits from circulation – to retire them, effectively removing that carbon from the atmosphere. This retirement can be done directly by burning TCO2 tokens, as well as with Toucan carbon reference tokens like BCT.

💖 What can you build?
Our bet is that we can fix many of the problems with legacy carbon markets by applying the dynamism of the Web3 to the problem. The Toucan Protocol is open, permissionless infrastructure, and we are actively growing our community of projects building with us.
A few ideas of dApps and protocols we'd love to see built on Toucan:
Retail burning products: calculate and burn, pay with crypto, get an NFT; climate action subscriptions with Superfluid; send ETH / tokens to a carbon burn address to retire.
Institutional retirement products: purchase and burn credits, receive a publicly-verifiable certificate of retirement with details of every credit / project / vintage retired.
Sustainable creator economy projects: green NFTs.
DeFi retirement products and services: protocol-level retirements – a burn(); Solidity modifier?!
B2B and DAO2DAO carbon sales: empower large projects, events or communities like Devcon, mining pools, Layer 1 treasuries, stablecoin reserves etc to take publicly-verifiable action on climate change.
Carbon-backed currencies like Klima DAO.
Integrations with other ecosystem interfaces like Zerion, Zapper, Metamask etc.
A carbon-backed metaverse forest with Atlantis World.

🛣️ What's next
We've been researching and building Toucan since ETHLondon last year, and have launched the protocol on Polygon mainnet in October 2021. Now, we're growing — we'd love your support.

4017,swell-network-maintaining-a-decentralised-open-an,"About Swell Network

What is Swell Network?



Swell Network is aiming to ensure that Ethereum remains a public good for the benefit of the global community. We are building a non-custodial, permissionless, and liquid Ethereum staking solution. 

Ethereum’s transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) will see the need for validators to stake their ETH in order to support the updated consensus mechanism to maintain the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain.

Swell Network will support this process through 3 key pillars

Liquid Staking: The first pillar ETH holders with a means to stake their ETH in a liquid manner through a staking derivative token (named Swell ETH token or ‘swETH’) which will serve to incentivise and encourage staking to secure the network.
DPools: The second pillar ETH holders with a simplified means to stake ETH without the present financial hurdles of requiring 32ETH and technical barriers associated with maintaining uptime and infrastructure. We achieve through our soon-to-launch decentralised mini pools (or dPools).
Decentralised Marketplace: The third pillar is the development of a decentralised marketplace to enable ETH holders to connect with node operators to ultimately help to secure the Ethereum network.


What are Swell Network’s principles?



Swell Network is built on the same fundamental principles of the Ethereum ecosystem. These principles include:

Non-custodial: ETH holders could utilise our first to market innovation atomic transaction to become the direct depositor and stake directly into the validator which makes Swell Network fully non-custodial.
Permissionless: Swell Network is developing a permissionless node operator marketplace to help client diversification and network decentralisation. 
Liquidity: Swell Network is providing extra value to the Ethereum ecosystem by removing the present opportunity cost of staking ETH by delivering a liquid staking derivative.

Gitcoin, Swell Network, and Ethereum: Public Good

Why a Gitcoin Grant?

Swell Network is a passionate and driven community that believes in freedom, self-sovereignty, and decentralisation. We believe that Ethereum is a key pillar for Web3 and must be protected, secured, and supported at all costs.

We have been catalysed by a small team that is driven to play a small role in upholding the integrity, reliability, and security of Ethereum as it fully transitions into Proof of Stake.

Our core service is specialising in Ethereum because we are true believers in the technology and the principles for which it stands. This is Swell Network’s first-ever Gitcoin application and we look forward to contributing to the growth of Ethereum and Web3 overall.

Why should you contribute?

By contributing to our grant, you are contributing to a like-minded project that is helping to preserve Ethereum as a public good. Your donations will go towards product development, community-building, as well as awareness marketing, to spread the message about decentralised, open, and liquid staking.

Swell Network’s staking offering provides users the private benefit of being able to earn financial rewards in the most free way possible, whilst also driving wider public benefits of securing the blockchain.

How is Swell Network helping maintain Ethereum as a public good?

The central mission of Swell Network is aiming to help accelerate the adoption of ETH staking by providing a non-custodial, permissionless, and liquid ETH staking protocol. With decentralisation and security front-of-mind, we believe that the more ETH staked by a diversity of actors to secure the network, the better. As a result, Swell Network is contributing to maintaining Ethereum as a public good for all.

GR13 Updates

Thank you to everyone who participated and donated in GR12. We look forward to continuing our mission to maintain Ethereum as a public good by building a truly decentralised, permissionless and non-custodial liquid staking protocol.

Overall, the financial resources provided through the Gitcoin Grant funding was directed to Swell’s Treasury which is continuing to invest heavily into product development as well as security / audit / assurance.

We are excited to continue the next round of Gitcoin Grants with GR 13.

A lot has happened since we first published the Swell Network Grant in the last round. Here is a quick snapshot of recent developments:



1. Seed capital secured to drive protocol development: Swell recently closed a seed round led by industry leading crypto-native venture capital funds, firms, and angels.

2. Swell v2 scheduled for release in Q2 ahead of the merge: Swell v2 is currently in development with smart contracts now complete and ready for audit. We have multiple audits planned to help ensure security and safety within the protocol with an tentative release date of Q2.

3. Core contributor hiring is now underway: Swell has opened hiring for best-in-class core contributors to help drive Swell’s vision to deliver the next-generation of Ethereum staking. Positions are open across engineering, business development, and community / marketing.




Thank you again for your support. At Swell, one of our primary objectives beyond providing the next generation of liquid staking for Ethereum, is to help provide a layer to safeguard the decentralisation and security of the underlying Ethereum blockchain. 

Our emphasis on the values of being permissionless, open, and global for both stakers and node operators aligns to the overarching premise of blockchain as a public good for society.



GR14 Updates




Thank you to everyone who has kindly contributed to Swell's Gitcoin Grants campaign.

Since the last round of funding, we've utilized your contributions to further our core mission of helping to ensure Ethereum remains a public good. 

We are bringing this to life through the responsible development of our community-driven liquid staking protocol, which plays a critical role in ensuring Ethereum's ongoing decentralization and security. 

Since the last round, Swell again invested heavily into the necessary areas needed to build and ship a compelling, innovative, and forward-thinking liquid staking protocol.

(Side Note: As a sign of appreciation, Gitcoin Grant contributors also benefited from several perks with Swell, including gaining private beta testnet access to provide feedback to ensure our product represents the community's desires.)

Here is a quick rundown of what we have been working on since the last round.

Testnet: Swell has launched its testnet with 400+ testers from around the world, including some leading institutional node operators which will help ensure our product is thoroughly tested prior to our soft mainnet launch in the coming weeks.
Audits: Swell continued to investing heavily into smart contract security, including most recently with best-in-class firms such as Runtime Verification.
Liquidity bootstrapping: Swell has made concentrated efforts to bootstrap TVL and LP depth for our staking derivative (swETH). More information coming on this soon.
Resourcing: Swell is now fully resourced with a dedicated team of full-time core contributors who are focussed on delivering on what we as a community have envisioned to be the future of staking.
Partnerships: Swell has made progress in firming up industry partnerships including with node operators, protocols, and others.

With the current GR14 round, we are looking to extend our community and invest your contributions into multiple areas, including: ongoing security audits as well as efforts to raise awareness for Swell as a product to drive further diversity in the Ethereum liquid staking protocol market. Thank you for your support.

THE DREAM.

The goal of Cryptostamping is to introduce authenticity & transparency in the digital world, a new system through which people can stamp and add value to their content, certify, show support, talk or comment. 

The internet grows endlessly, and it is in much need of a system that can organize all this jumbled content, filter the spam & bot-gen, push up what is user-valued. And our goal is to make sure this power rests with the users, in a transparent & decentralized way. 

Thanks to blockchain technology, all this is made possible now. Join us in building a better web experience.












THE HOW.

The project relies heavily on smart contracts and NFTs to achieve this goal. People can buy an NFT and use it to stamp on any particular web page, add value, show support, or comment upon the content. 

There are also many other use-case scenarios for stamping, please check https://cryptostamping.org/intro to learn more.

When internet started, people made or created platforms that can get you to content (google), to share content (Facebook), to pay (PayPal), all in separated individual platforms, in webpages or apps, but with the on-set of blockchain technology, people are going back & starting a new trend where the functionality is in a place between the user & the commodity (Metamask connects users to apps to pay stuff) 

And this is the motive Cryptostamping stands for, to only act as a middleware between the user & digital content. The plugin will let you stamp & comment on any webpage and similarly view all stamps on any webpage. The entire functionality exists on the browser side in user control.

An opensource embed widget that lets visitors to add their NFT stamp, users can embed this anywhere from articles to videos, to collect public opinions or support or any other use-cases mentioned above. The embed creates a standard for all other layered utilities of NFTs in future, making sure the button is safe. There are also plans to make this hosted on IPFS completely decentralizing it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ECS (Ethereum Cryptostamping Standard)

We will be introducing a new protocol called ECS which will take care of the basic functionality of all stamping related functionality and regulations. As we grow, there will be iterative of ECS1, ECS2, ECS3.. that adapt to the latest needs of the stamping system. the protocol is purely optional for fine tuning, any NFT collection can be listed directly at https://cryptostamping.org/get-listed

Git Repo for ECS

WORKING & AUTHENTICITY

When you stamp, metadata would have to be signed specifically through your wallet, it will collect the NFT token address & id, your wallet address, and store it along with signature from Metamask. When someone opens the site or post, it will verify whether the stored stamps truly do belong to their owners, maybe the stamp got transferred or burned or something. It does this through the transaction history of that stamp, and check if the wallet address in stamping matches the current owner. In this way, a stamp will be displayed only after it's verified.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ETH 2.0 & ON-CHAIN STAMPING.

Currently, we are building and working using off-chain signing standard, much similar to how snapshot.org works, but in Q1/Q2 2023, we will be moving everything to on-chain stamping, the gas costs will still be considerable (~0.06 USD), though with techs like zk and shard chains, we believe the transactions will be much cheaper in future.

484,depo-dao-decentralized-politics-dao-panvala-leagu,"Govrn and Peeps Democracy have partnered to build DEPO DAO to fund the future of decentralized politics. We want to be able to support truly collaborative open-source efforts that are non partisan from the beginning and remain that way to the end. By funding and encouraging open-source projects, we can start to break down the political barriers that currently restrain us from real progress.

As a member of the Panvala League - we're asking for donations to be made in PAN if possible so that your donations are eligible for both the Gitcoin Match and the Panvala Match. (If you can't donate in PAN, all tokens are still accepted.)

Panvala League Community Goals - Fall Quarter (Oct - Dec):

As a member of the Panvala League, your donations or stake to DePo DAO will be additionally matched (learn more here). Our goals for the next quarter are as follows:
Fund at least 1 external project that is building a non-partisan crypto project working towards ""Decentralized Politics""
Fund 1 internal open source project to for the DePo Community.
Create decentralized politics ecosystem funding framework

More information on our proposals and discussion can be found in the notes from our last meeting (here)

Why are we starting this?

As we’ve been working in the Civic and Political Tech space, we’ve noticed several common traits:

-Most new innovative solutions in Civic and Political Tech space are still focused on Web 2.0 solutions for the current state of politics;
 
-Most of the funding for new applications comes from partisan sources with specific political agendas (not great for real experimentation); and

-Funding is limited for these projects, which encourages solutions to close wall their resources and discourages collaboration.

How do we make this happen?

We want to be able to build a community around decentralized politics experiments. That starts with 1) funding micro grants for open-source projects committed to experimenting with decentralized politics and 2) hosting meetups to bring buidlers in this space together to work on the problems that will define democracy 2.0.

How does this actually take shape? 

We already have a landing page at depodao.com and are setting up a PeepsDAO at peepsdao.com to collect DAI and coordinate our efforts. Now we're looking for support from the Gitcoin community to help us build a stash of funds for supporting the best open-source projects in the space. All funded projects will be chosen by members of the DAO and must publish their source code under an open-source license on github. 

Guiding Principles:

Our guiding principles are simple when it comes to what we'll support. Projects will need to be: 

-Multi-partisan or non-partisan (can’t just serve one party); 

-Inclusive of radical ideas for politics with more democracy + decentralization; and/or

-Flat organizations where funders and developers collaborate to buidl a better modl for society.

Marduk is a platform that allows to automatically create scientific databases from a list of research papers. In turn, this provides an opportunity to train machine learning models to gain insights into the field and generate new ideas.

What are we doing?

We create a web app that will help you to structure your data into a machine-readable format. The user can upload a large list of publications, and we will help him automatically create a table with custom columns of any nature.

The main features of our app will include:

Table autocompletion
A smart reader that highlights 
Filtration and visualization of the results
Public data sharing
Team access and collaborative work


Why does our project matter for longevity research?

New research is often built on the preceding one. Being on the edge of science and not wasting your time reading thousands of papers only for a few informative paragraphs is a key advantage.

We collaborate actively with Open Genes and Open Longevity. The first one has already created a database of human genes associated with ageing, and the latest one is collecting data on lifespan-extending drugs. Both of them are open-source, and essential for successful research.

Manual creation of such databases is tedious, and we want to help them and many other researchers and laboratories all over the world. Users will be able to share their analyses and reviews with everyone else, which will increase the research pace drastically.

We believe that openness is a way to grow big. Aggregating and providing access to data is essential for field development.

How does it all work?


A prototype mock-up of our service.

After uploading a list of PDFs and establishing a table structure, our neural network will parse papers with respect to table columns and will fill in possible values in the table cells.
Users will be able to share their table projects, and work on them as a team, or even start an open-source project on the platform! One particular use case is a public leaderboard, where different treatments of age-related diseases will compete in terms of efficacy.
Later we intend to add semantic search and autoloading of the most recent research papers.

What is ready now?

We are a very early stage start-up. Right now we are actively working on the front-end and NLP engine. 

That is why we need your help. The funds raised by this grant will enable us to run our service, keep the servers, finish our front-end and train our models. As soon as our front-end will be ready, we will provide access to our app to collect user data and start training our models. The earlier it happens, the better the models will be.

The Underscore Protocol (_Prtcl) can be seen as an ""operating system"" for building modular and reusable web applications that are compatible with centralized and decentralized platforms and that work with platform-agnostic interoperable data objects. 

It achieves this by introducing the concept of Evolving Entities or ""Evees"", and the Cortex Framework, an engine for building reusable micro-frontend modules. 

Evees are platform-agnostic objects that combine key features of two powerful tools, the World Wide Web with its URLs, and GIT with its commits and branches. 

With Evees, any piece of content on any app and platform can be referenced, rendered and mutated by anyone on any other app and platform. 

Evees can be rendered and manipulated through Cortex Modules: reusable micro-frontend modules that bundle together logic, web-components, and storage connections for different types of data, and is what makes data interoperability among different applications possible.

What we have done so far

_Prtcl is platform-agnostic, meaning you can have content that lives on a web-server and jumps to Ethereum, back and forth. Check it out!. We will soon be delivering a DAO-governed scalable wiki for DAOStack, please check our PoC.

What we need the funds for

_Prtcl is being registered as a DAO using a Vermont's Blockchain-based LLC legal entity and implementing the Reasonable funding model in which founders and investors have limited economical and governance rights that must be handed to the community as they are paid back.

With your contribution, you will be helping us cover for legal expenses (~5k USD) related to the incorporation (already studied and approved by Gravel and Shea, one of key promoters of the BBLLC figure) while enabling experimentation in the field of DAO-powered innovative business entities.

4296,boston-matrix,"Update since the previous GitCoin round

(1) We have tested several compounds. The most interesting was a combination of EDTA (3 µM), Aminoguanidine (30 µM), Alagebrium (10 µM), Pyridoxamine (10 µM), and Tanine (0.15 µM). The anti-glycation effect of each individually was close to zero (1,4±10,3, -13,9±13,2, -29,1±2,7, -4,2±7,4, -15,4±4,3 [M±SEM]). While the combination preliminary gave us 54,0±3,3 [M±SEM].

In other words, according to the results of the study, antiglycation compounds with different mechanisms of action (chelator, antiradical agent, amadorin, carbonyl compound trapper, anti-crosslinking, and deglycating agent) did not show antiglycation activity at selected concentrations, while their combination showed the presence of desired activity. This suggests that the resulting action is formed due to the synergy of individual activity mechanisms that act on the glycation reaction in different ways and at its various stages. 

(2) We have worked out a spin-off project from the current one. This is a 3-step program called Body Reassembling, Boston Matrix being the 1st step. This is a stage-by-stage program for the restoration of the human body: combating the consequences of extracellular matrix glycation of different half-lives, increasing the survival rate of stem cells and epigenetic rejuvenation, and restoring long-lived matrices of the musculoskeletal system. You can take a closer look here.

(3) BTW. We’ve also published a book on aging biology recently, one of the chapters being about ECM. This chapter has already been translated into English, you can find a link in the top part of the description, in the update section here (we are campaigning for the book translation into English on GitCoin too).


Initial description of the campaigne

Rejuvenating Extracellular Matrix to Fight Aging

Our mission is to develop a therapy that prevents age-related degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). We are focused on small molecules that have the potential to slow down aging, and protect people from diabetes, cardiovascular and Alzheimer’s diseases, by inhibiting cross-linking in the extracellular matrix. Boston Matrix is ​​a nonprofit. Our research and development process is transparent, and results are reported openly.

We are building a bioinformatic platform for screening molecules — ""expanding"" intermediate and endproducts of glycation (AGE), with subsequent validation in cell cultures and model animals.

In parallel, we are working on the screening and development of RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation endproducts) blocking molecules, through which AGEs induce inflammation and tissue degeneration.

The results of the project will form the basis for the development of a drug with a double protective effect: protecting blood circulation and metabolism in the nervous system.


Our Research and Experiment

We are currently working on rationalized design, synthesis and bioscreening of polysubstituted imidazoles and their bioisosters as antiglycating agents and RAGE inhibitors for reduction of the extracellular matrix rigidity, and associated pathological effects. The project is aimed at creating new substances (or finding suitable ones among already existing compounds) for slowing down aging processes associated with pathological glycation. 

There are 3 main directions now: synthesis and screening of new compounds as well as in silico screening among known therapeutic agents (and, in case of success, further in vitro and in vivo bio testing), based on our hypothesis on DF-5 possible mechanism of action, which will be studied on different models.



The project is based on the research of compound DF5, which appeared to be the leading molecule for further drug design, as well as a hypothesis on the mechanism of DF5 action and protocols for preliminary testings, which were already developed by our scientific team. The agreement on collaboration with representatives of original DF5 developers was achieved, and some leading structures were designed, and ideas for simple and more sophisticated screening models were developed (see Fig. 2 and 3).


(Figure 2: The general concept)


(Figure 3: An example of a simple planned chemical screening)



What We Need Funding for

For the purchase of various chemical agents, deuterated solvents, laboratory animals, and laboratory equipment; it also covers compensation for the scientists involved.



ECM and Aging

The extracellular matrix (ECM) fills the spaces between cells and serves as an internal network that connects the entire body. It makes up more than 30% of the body weight of an adult. Most of the ECM proteins (collagens and elastins) are formed during childhood and are poorly restored.

As we age, these proteins form chemical bonds with each other, called cross-links. This reduces the elasticity of the matrix, promoting inflammation and tissue degeneration.

Non-enzymatic glycation is a pathogenic mechanism accompanied by the generation of AGEs compounds in ECM. The latter are involved in the disruption of microenvironmental, regulatory and structural functions of stroma, changes in cellular metabolism, biochemical/bioelectrical parameters of cells, development of diseases with a high degree of association with age-related pathologies.

Connext is building Layer 2 micropayment infrastructure for the decentralized web.

Connext sits on top of the Ethereum blockchain and existing web protocols like HTTP. The protocol uses a system of networked state channels, a technology that allows peers to make unbreakable commitments to one another, all of which can be adjudicated and resolved on the Ethereum blockchain in the event of a dispute. This lets users of the system make near-free, instant, programmable transfers in any currency, without ever needing to rely on third parties to store funds.

What have we done?

Connext's technology can be used to interconnect EVM-compatible Layer 2 solutions such as rollup chains across Connext nodes. We showcased this in a demo for Reddit's Scaling Challenge: https://medium.com/connext/introducing-spacefold-d1c227a29d3 . We believe this is an extremely powerful construct that will significantly improve liquidity and onboarding/offboarding UX of siloed Layer 2 solutions, and we are excited to show off more projects like this. 

We also worked with ExchangeUnion to release a Layer 3 solution for swapping between Connext's ETH mainnet and Lightning's BTC networks: https://blog.exchangeunion.com/launching-opendex-the-decentralized-exchange-standard-b907d2a99b5a

For those who have not been following us over the years, we have been building state channel systems in production since 2018. We built the original SpankChain SpankPay micropayment solution on mainnet, the first Ethereum mainnet state channel system in production. We built InstaPay, Metamask Mobile's in-app integration of Connext technology. We've also worked on integrations and PoCs with companies including dTok, Pitch, Loft.Radio, Zympay.

What is this grant for?

We have used our learnings from real-world usage to build an extremely secure, optimized, and simple state channel protocol from the ground up: https://github.com/connext/vector. This system is an opinionated state channel protocol tailored for our specific use case: cross-chain/L2 conditional payments. By sticking to a single use case, we were able to reduce complexity and improve user experience significantly, and we are really excited to unveil our work!

Funds from this grant will be used to accelerate development on our Vector state channel protocol and allow us to ship a battle-hardened system that feels magical to use. Questions? Check out our Discord for more info, or to chat with us about anything: https://discord.com/invite/raNmNb5

To create a sustainable blockchain ecosystem that makes philanthropy easy, fun, and profitable.
 
What is Leyline?
Leyline is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collectible platform centered on digital identity & avatars minted from acts of social good. We incentivize our global community to donate and volunteer to nonprofit causes. Participation creates a source of income in the form of NFTs and crypto prizes. We serve the entire social good ecosystem, which includes nonproﬁts, NGOs, their volunteers, foundations, corporations, education institutions, NFT avatar/art collectors, and the individual change agents who support them. Leyline, as the go-to NFT Platform for Social Good, evolves around these core mechanics:
Good deeds performed through our platform are rewarded with Good Points and a gamified experience. Good Points are then used to mint and level up Leyline NFTs.
Leyline Avatars and collectibles are unique and valuable NFTs. These are sought after by NFT collectors to form their metaverse identity and populate their virtual art galleries.
Through charity events, we organize fundraising supporting specific causes, using NFTs as assets to be purchased.
Our robust and dynamic NFT marketplace provides fair commission, fundraising and operation allocations through smart contracts.
Our NFTs will evolve in utility and become more deeply gamified over time, fostering collaboration, competition, and engagement around altruistic actions. Eventually, the level of human story and engagement embedded in our NFTs will become a key driver of value.
Leyline Utility Token ($LEY) provides owners access to Leyline community and services. $LEY will be used to connect Leyline to the broader economic ecosystem.
Our Proof of Good Protocol, which is made up of Good Points, NFTs and LEY$, grants stakeholders privileges to Leyline’s decentralized governance. This effectively makes Leyline a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where our community will drive and shape the future of doing good.
 
In addition, We provide education about crypto, NFTs, and blockchain for our community. Our network of mentors also provides training for digital professionals (design, art, music, NFTs) and academic subjects. We foster value creation, awareness, engagement, and retention for the social good ecosystem through our platform and services.
 
Goals
Be the #1 provider of NFT fundraising services for nonprofits, around the globe.
Be in the top 10 most valuable NFT avatars in the metaverse (a la Cryptopunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club).
Lift over 1 million people out of extreme poverty, indefinitely, through their own acts of altruism.
Build a platform/ecosystem approach that transcends into other markets, and returns a constant stream of value and meaning back to the social good ecosystem. 
 
 
Leyline is a 501c3 California Nonprofit Organization and an open-source, open-knowledge project. We are going to re-invest profits to where it is needed most: improving lives, helping communities, and sustaining the one planet we all share.

2844,nftstory-open-source-evm-nft-storytelling-tools-f,"🏡nftstory is making storytelling tools for crypto creators. 
Our initial release is an open source EVM-based NFT minter and primary marketplace designed to make creating high quality NFTs easy, affordable, social, and fun. See the Mumbai testnet beta in action or request a creator invite.

Motivation
NFTs are a powerful blockchain primitive transforming the financial horizons for creators online. NFTs are a tangible, object-oriented interface to smart contracts that make the blockchain legible and culturally relevant to a global audience. They constitute a financial lifeline to creators cast into precarity by limitless digital reproducibility and the unprecedented centralization of social media distribution. NFTs enable new forms of decentralized authentication, community building, data permanence, and so much more, all within the same blockchain networks as DeFi and on-chain governance.

🏡nftstory is an experiment in building opinionated open source tools for telling great stories with NFTs. Our goal is to see if it is possible to put greater power in the hands of creators. These ideas come together around the idea of an NFT's story. 

Story
What makes an NFT's story so important?

To many new NFT artists' surprise, NFTs are not intrinsically valuable. Just because one creates an NFT does not make it desirable or important. Making an NFT interesting is the job of the artist. The artist's role is to imbue an NFT with value through storytelling.

A compelling NFT narrative can come together any number of ways. For example, the artist's life story, or the origins of the particular work, the aesthetics it draws upon, or the on-chain mechanics it mobilizes can all contribute to creating that immaterial happening that gives a token value. Some NFTs are valued for their historical significance, while others are cherished for their roles in niche communities. Whether NFTs are created to be sold or stored away as mementos for posterity, their value is intertwined with the stories they represent.

Mission
🏡nftstory's mission is to build storytelling engines that empower crypto creators. That means building opinionated open source tools for creating high quality NFTs and smart contracts, and playful, social interfaces that give creators the best chance of connecting with fellow artists and collectors. 

Challenges
NFT creators today face several challenges:
Minting Fees: Gas prices on Ethereum make NFT minting inaccessible to many creators who cannot access fiat on-ramps because they are outlawed in their jurisdiction, for fear of KYC, or who are not yet 18 years old. For creators who can purchase cryptocurrency, the $30 to $175 minting and listing fees per NFT, depending on platform, can make Crypto Art an irresponsible financial risk (source: PumpMyGas). Making and selling NFTs should be accessible to anyone who can install an Ethereum wallet. 
Platform Fees: Popular galleries (invite-only marketplaces) charge a 15% commission on primary sales. These fees are deducted from creator compensation, not levied on top of the total sale price. 
NFT Immutability: After several controversies, collectors have grown weary of mutable NFTs generated by gasless NFT minting platforms. Informed collectors demand unambiguously immutable NFTs. 
Supply Outpacing Demand: Accessible minting tools increase NFT supply, but do not necessarily increase collector demand. Amidst a noisier NFT marketplace, it is harder than ever for new creators to break through and make connections with collectors who appreciate their story. NFT creators need tools that help them generate excitement and build narrative momentum.
Security: Proof of Stake NFT marketplaces built on non-EVM blockchains, such as Hicetnunc and Flow, lack the security and decentralization of Ethereum and the interoperability of EVM chains such as Polygon and L2s such as Optimism and Arbitrum. EVM-based NFT minting enables flexible deployment to the maximum security L1 chain and more affordable L2s and PoS EVM L1s. NFTs within the Ethereum ecosystem are interoperable with other smart contracts. 
Ecology: Many artists are interested in NFT technology, but have reservations about the ecological impact of Proof of Work consensus mechanisms. During the Spring 2021 NFT hype cycle, many artists experienced harassment online for minting NFTs. NFT minting solutions should answer this important criticism by enabling energy efficient PoS minting and favor lazyminting on PoW chains. 
Artist-Owned Contracts: Decentralization is at the core of an NFTs value proposition, yet most no-code NFTs are minted on shared contracts with tens of thousands of unrelated NFTs. Creators should be empowered to easily deploy their own contracts and control them thereafter. 

Solutions
🏡nftstory v1 release introduces a new minting technology, a new sales format, and a user-friendly desktop and mobile friendly Dapp. 

Key Features
⚡NFTs are a new NFT format unique to 🏡nftstory. ⚡NFTs are free-to-create, 1 of 1 NFTs that are available for 24 hours only. When a buyer purchases a ⚡NFT, it's metadata and media are pinned to IPFS and backed up permanently on Arweave. If no one purchases the ⚡NFT within 24 hours, the permit disappears and the NFT is never minted. Creators can always purchase their own ⚡NFTs at gas cost to put the NFT onchain themselves. 
Content-Addressed Lazy Minting is the award winning technology powering ⚡NFTs. Built on the core lazy minting concept pioneered by OpenSea, content-addressed lazy mints (CALM) use the NFT's IPFS hash as its token ID, meaning these NFTs are truly immutable. 
Free to create. Creators simply sign the permit stating the minimum price they're willing to sell the ⚡NFT for, and that's it! No authorization or minting transactions are needed. Buyers pay the transaction fees to mint the NFT at purchase-time.
All you need is a wallet to mint on 🏡nftstory. Thanks to CALM technology, a newly initialized address with no balance can create and sell NFTs without any crypto coins or tokens whatsoever. That means otherwise uninitialized wallets can mint, earn crypto for selling NFTs, and boot truly anonymous crypto wallets.

Achievements
So far, with a bootstrapped budget of <$1500 USD, we have 
🏆 Won 1st place in the GreenNFT Gitcoin Solutions Bounty judged by CryptoPunks creators John Watkinson and Matt Hall (see Announcement, Github repo, Gitcoin page, and tl;dr Twitter thread).
🏗 Created the open source Content Addressed Lazy Minting (CALM) Solidity contract for lazyminting NFTs on EVM chains.
✨ Built a responsive Dapp on a modern stack including Preact, Mobx, Ethers.js, The Graph, IPFS, and Cloudflare.

Launch Plan
Polygon soft launch. Deploy to Polygon mainnet. Collect feedback from early users and hunt bugs in the frontend.
Bring artistic friend groups online. The greatest challenge creating a new marketplace for NFTs is attention. Our goal for the v1 soft launch is to attract groups of friends and collaborators to start minting together and egging each other on. This is much more important to the project's health than high profile individuals minting on their own. 
Share NFT creator invites. While everyone is welcome to view and purchase ⚡NFTs, creator access will be limited to wallets holding an 🏡nftstory Creator Invite NFT.

Future Plans
Deploy your own contract: The ⚡NFT contract architecture makes it trivial for creators to deploy their own proxy contracts. This means that a near future 🏡nftstory release could expose a ""Deploy proxy"" button, allowing creators to mint ⚡NFTs on contracts they control, using the same friendly Dapp interface anyone can use to mint on nftstory.life. 
Mint on L1: 🏡nftstory is launching on Polygon Matic first, but our contract is perfectly portable to other EVM chains and rollups such as Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, and so on. If there is demand to deploy on other chains, we can make that happen.

2836,digifizzy-a-native-web3-metaverse-publication,"DIGIFIZZY is the first dedicated and immersive metaverse magazine. It is serving the web3 metaverse community with ownable NFT material underwriting community education through web3 publishing. 

It was founded and launched by DIGITALAX— first digital fashion NFT and web3 protocol and infrastructure project— and is designed, engineered, curated, distributed all completely in house! In fact, I design all the pages myself and organise/curate all the content, and the DIGITALAX devs build it out! 

In each publication there are around 110 pages on average included with high quality content, interviews, articles, audio pieces etc. across fashion, gaming, crypto, DeFi, NFTs, music, esports, modding, web3. It is all about bringing together top, undervalued and unseen insights, voices and creators from across the space, targeted to serve both veterans in the community and also those wanting to learn more, onboard and get in! 

The magazine is released in the middle of every month, where we have released two issues so far. 

You can check out the first two issues here!: 
https://digifizzy.xyz/magazines/1/
https://digifizzy.xyz/magazines/2/


Through DIGIFIZZY we proved out a completely new publishing model with NFT based decentralised unlockable content. Some content creators, featured in the magazine, also created NFT metadata that DIGITALAX minted on Matic Network, contributing to these NFT based unlockable content bundles — from art to digital fashion to music to collectibles to physical to in-game items. 

This is not an auction or a typical drop, but unlike where if creators were featured on the cover of a traditional web2 or print magazine they would get nothing for it or sometimes even have to pay for placement, here they get a share distributed across the contributors to the bundle, whilst the publication is still able to prove out the model through a majority share, being the core creator, engineer, editor, distributor and contributor. 

See some of the unlockable content as part of the first two issues:
https://digifizzy.xyz/unlockable/1/
https://digifizzy.xyz/unlockable/2/

It's really about solving for the entire publishing industry the daunting web2 paywall, that we all can agree every reader hates. 

Digital fashion and the metaverse are great onboarding into web3, crypto, NFTs and the broader scope of decentralization. DIGIFIZZY is a direct way we can contribute to the broader ecosystem by providing high quality and digestible content that everyone can embrace. 

Our plans for the future include;
Continuing to release issues each month
Further optimising the UI and user experience, including load speeds, content immersivity etc. 
Integrating custom POAP features (Allowing for another new web3 publishing business model), where projects included in the magazine can choose to add interactive features to their page allowing for custom POAP tokens to be given to readers of the featured content/interview/article about them and they can use this to engage their readers and more directly and easily onboard them into their ecosystem i.e. those that do a quiz get a ""Project Name"" POAP.

Our Mission
The mission of our organization is to advocate for, serve as a source of education and awareness, and facilitate the adoption of revolutionary decentralized infrastructure and web3.0 technologies to solve one of the most pressing problems our rural communities face: a lack of access to modern broadband, advanced communications networks, and the knowledge necessary to integrate these emerging technologies leading the development of web into people's daily lives. 

The current limited connectivity in our rural areas has lead to much of our country being cut off from vital services and had a disproportionately negative impact on both individuals and businesses to even be aware of these dramatic paradigm shifts in technology (let alone adapt to them), leaving them at a severe disadvantage when compared to cities and wealthy areas that can afford to keep up with this rapid development of technological standards that are driving change of the world economy into the future, and where this technology adoption is already becoming common enough place for many people to begin actively using these tokenized systems and standards in their daily lives.

By leveraging the most disruptive blockchain technology projects and platforms in the decentralized infrastructure field to provide communities with invaluable knowledge and the hands-on resources needed to build this vital infrastructure we can stop the endless cycle of “catch-up” the rural parts of our country have been struggling with, continually using previous generation solutions to try and solve next generation problems.
With the power these technologies have to level the playing field and further democratize everything from finance to the internet itself, given the proper guidance, we can provide the necessary solutions to our broadband crisis and the ever-widening digital divide. By making these technologies more accessible than ever we can bring even the smallest and most disconnected communities into the 21st century and provide them the services and the tools needed to participate in the global economy.

Our Team
As veterans of the telecom and tech industry with extensive experience and understanding of this next generation of blockchain-based decentralized technology that is revolutionizing everything from the core of how the internet operates, to the applications that run atop it, and all the ways it touches and runs our lives, we have become the first non-profit in our field to not just advocate for community networks and the adoption of blockchain technology, but provide communities with the hands-on resources and experience they need to build this type of next generation technology. Our forward-thinking model facilitates both necessary education and the resources for the creation of infrastructure that provides fast and affordable broadband access to un-connected and under-served communities but also fosters the creation of highly skilled, highly desirable, sustainable jobs, improves local businesses ability to grow and participate in the global economy, and attract outside economic development.

Our Model
We aim to work with communities in a variety of ways to meet them on their level and provide the resources they need to lift them up to where they need to be. Our model provides communities with three primary paths to build these networks and gain access to the fast and affordable connectivity that they need, and the education on the use of these systems to improve their daily lives and operations of their businesses:

We work in close coordination with the community to provide the full service of building and operating these decentralized broadband networks, whereby we handle all the logistics of ownership and operation of the core network, while still leaving full ownership of the last-mile infrastructure distributed to participating members of the community.
We serve as the catalyst for communities to start their own autonomous broadband co-ops, as well as further providing them with long term guidance and any resources they can’t otherwise locally source to ensure their organization and network are successful in continuing to grow and evolve to meet future needs.
We advise or partner with existing local ISP’s that are facing challenges in connecting hard to reach customers, helping them to improve their operations and expand their service area.

Regardless of the path each communities chooses we can provide a solution that not only meets their needs for the necessary infrastructure that can provide them modern connectivity. Through a combination of advocacy and education around these emerging decentralized infrastructure and web3.0 standards, help in fostering the creation of successful organizations that can provide highly skilled, highly desirable, sustainable jobs typically unavailable in most rural communities, provide vital services that local businesses need to grow and operate more efficiently, and help attract outside economic stimulus.

UPDATE! We have been working on the artwork for these NFTs, some of the tokens will feature VoskCoin Doodle Art from our recent Helium HNT miner release! You can still support this initiative in Gitcoins Grants Round 10!


NFTs are all the rage right now, but what is a non-fungible token anyway?! Hi! My name is Drew Vosk of the VoskCoin YouTube channel, we are one of the biggest and fastest-growing crypto YouTube channels ever with over 240,000 subscribers and ~3 million views monthly.

Sales volumes of NFTs grew over 29x in February according to Messaris data, which is parabolic growth.

Yet, most people still don't even know what an NFT is, what NFT stands for, how to buy one, and most importantly how to create your own NFT. This video series will be constructed to show educate new users not just on what an NFT is but how to become an active NFT user from buying and selling NFTs, to even creating their own!

As part of this project, we will be sending NFTs to any Ethereum addresses left below with a Gitcoin grant donation for making this project a (hopeful) reality. These NFTs do not have any value or any implied value and this is in no way, shape, or form meant to encourage donors to simply collect these potential Non-fungible tokens that will be creating in this video series. This is simply a fun way to distribute the tokens to supporters of the VoskCoin mission which is simply to create fun and informative crypto video content that can be viewed for free on YouTube!

To summarize, all funding from this grant will be used to compensate our decentralized team for creating educational video content all around NFTs, mainly on the Ethereum or associated blockchains, as well as pay the insane gas fees for minting NFTs.

If you want to support VoskCoin in creating general Ethereum education videos, please review our grant for that!

Important Note: The ""Lifetime funding"" is wrong.

What is Rotki?

Rotki is an open source portfolio tracking, accounting, analytics and tax reporting tool that protects your privacy.

The mission of Rotki is to bring transparency into the crypto and financial sectors through the use of open source. Most importantly unlike virtually every other competing service which consists of closed source SaaS onto which you are forced to hand over all your financial data, with Rotki your data is stored encrypted locally in your computer. It enables you to take ownership of your financial data.

Why a Gitcoin Grant?

We are using this Gitcoin grant to attempt to partially fund the development of the project. Funding opensource work is a hard problem and we want to try what Gitcoin can do towards alleviating that problem. Especially since we currently have a ton of feature requests (https://github.com/rotki/rotki/issues) and we are but 4 developers working on it full-time. The project is at the moment self-funded. Proper funding would change that and allow us to get more developers and better infrastructure to provide better experience for our users.

rotki is opensource. Everything we create is available to study, copy, modify and use in your own apps too. That part of rotki is a public good. The Gitcoin grant's purpose is to fund exactly that part. The opensource public good part of rotki.

Results of Grants round 13

We want to sincerely thank all the people who contributed to the 13th Gitcoin grant CLR round! It was a really good donations round and we managed to cover the biggest part of our development and infrastructure expenses for the last 3 months. Thank you so much.

What have we achieved since then?

Gitcoin grants round 13 ended in the end of March 2022. In less than 3 months we took your trust in us earnestly and have managed to do a lot of things!
First and foremost the team has grown by 3 more developers! And on the software side we made the biggest release rotki has ever had since its creation! For details of the releases check below.

2687,njombe-innovation-academy-panvala-league,"Unleashing the potential of local youth to transform social challenges into social enterprises. Njombe Innovation Academy replicates the social innovation academy (SINA) model in Njombe (Tanzania).

Our activities since last GR
Yohana and Ester are enjoying their learning journey at SINA in Uganda. They successfully completed the first stage (applied)


Yohana prepared this short video about their experience

Ester wrote this piece about their long trip to Uganda and her first impressions at SINA
Yohana has also been busy interviewing social entrepreneurs ""born"" at SINA. Here and example and check his Youtube channel for more

Back in Njombe, NIA co-hosted the Innovation Week Tz which took place for the first time in our region, Njombe. Read about it! 

Back in February/March Ibra conducted this interesting session about Tanzania within the Post Growth Entrepreneurship (PGE) incubator  

Also at PGE incubator, we ended with a NIA pitch by Unai 

Description
Njombe region´s main economic activities are agriculture (76.3% of GDP) and livestock keeping. Local youth have few employment opportunities. Around 10% are unemployed and face unfavourable conditions to become entrepreneurs; hence, they usually engage in informal and unstable income-generating activities such as “mishe mishe” (daily small jobs) or seasonal farming. Youth who have not completed secondary or higher education (41% are out of school in secondary) are the most affected since they lack the skills and network to create or find decent income-generating activities. At the same time, Njombe faces social challenges such as malnutrition (levels of stunting are 49.4 %), HIV (11.4% prevalence) or poverty (GDP/capita 10% lower than the national level).

Could we create an environment where local youth gain the tools and mindset to transform the challenges that surround them into social enterprises? SINA has the answer. 


The SINA model has proven that through a cost-effective and “freesponsible” community approach, marginalized youth can become self-reliant and can create a future for themselves through social enterprises, which in turn disrupt the root causes of social problems. Skills are gained by taking up responsibilities within self-organization in a SINA community. Youth grow personally and professionally while putting learned tools immediately into practice.

Social enterprises which emerged range from organic mosquito repellant soap to construction out of plastic bottles or a flooring solution from plastic bags and eggshells. SINA scholars have gone as far as being recognized by the Queen of England, Obama or Ban Ki-moon as changemakers and social entrepreneurs.

This model has already been replicated in countries other than its origin, Uganda; thus, planting a “SINA model seed” in Njombe will probably lead to additional self-organized spaces for social entrepreneurship across Tanzania.

The ecosystem in Njombe is ready for SINA: there is political will, learning spaces and technologies, innovators and the interest of local youth who are already paying to attend training offered by Mzee Pwagu and SHIPO. A social innovation academy will be the space to bring together local (young) actors, provide them with additional skills and create a self-sustaining ecosystem that turns local challenges into social enterprises.  

Theory of Change
The desired impact is an increased number of social challenges tackled in Njombe by youth-led enterprises with locally available resources. In order to achieve that we will bootstrap a self-organised community of youth in Njombe who commonly owns and manages resources (material, knowledge, financial, social) to create social enterprises out of challenges (outcome). It is assumed that the potential and leadership to create positive social and environmental impact of local youth will be unleashed through the SINA model. 

Expected outputs after 2 years:
10 local youth (scholars) are capacitated to become coaches and mentors of future cohorts (3 in Uganda and 7 in Njombe). It is assumed that scholars trained in Uganda have incentives to create a SINA community in Njombe.
At least 20 scholars trained per year who create 5 social enterprises per year. It is assumed that successful scholars and enterprises have incentives to continue to contribute to the SINA community in Njombe.
Mechanisms for the sustainability of the academy are in place. It is assumed that those mechanisms create the required culture (freedom and responsibility, knowledge sharing and mutual support, shared finances, shared materials and space, teamwork & collaboration) for the sustainability of the community.

Milestones               
2 young people from Njombe complete SINA´s 5 stage replication process in Uganda - 6,000 USD
Space and materials ready in Njombe, including water, food and electricity provision systems - 20,000 USD
1st and 2nd cohorts of scholars in Njombe - 15,000 USD
1st social enterprise registered in Njombe
An enterprise has a 2 million TZS turnover
1st cohort of certified trainers
Secured funding to run another year

Strategic approach & sustainability
2-3 youth (at least 1 woman) will stay at SINA in Uganda for 9 months to become equipped with all the skills and tools necessary to replicate the model in Njombe. In the meantime, in Njombe, the learning space will be arranged, materials will be procured, SINA Njombe will be registered, local mentors and coaches will be selected and a selection process will be carried out to select 20 participants of the first cohort in Njombe. At least 50% of the selected participants will be women, 15% will be people with disabilities and all of them will come from marginalised and/or poor backgrounds.
Within NIA´s first 2 years, two cohorts of scholars will undergo SINA´s empowerment process (one cohort each year) while living together and co-creating a self-organised, commons-based, feminist and transparent community with open source principles, benefiting from the experience of those youth who stayed in Uganda. Their enterprises will then move into the incubation phase. Before the second cohort starts a “train-the-trainer” training will take place where scholars will get ready to become the life-coaches, mentors, training facilitators and self-management trainers of the second cohort.

In the short term we will look for financial sources (e.g. local business people). In the medium term social enterprises ""born"" at NIA will be the main source of income, with donations matched by Panvala and we will experiment with tokenisation or community currencies.

Implementation arrangements
Local youth are the key project agents: they are not “passive beneficiaries” but active agents who lead the creation of a SINA community in Njombe. The other agents offer a conducive environment and provide support and expertise in required topics. This arrangement has already been successfully implemented to replicate SINA communities in Zimbabwe or DRC, to mention a few. It allows youth to gain skills by taking up responsibilities within self-organization in a SINA community and to grow personally and professionally while putting learned tools immediately into practice.  
All the agents will walk the talk and self-organise with Holacracy, a SHIPO representative filling the lead link role. All the agents will walk the talk and self-organise with Holacracy. Hence, decision-making (including the chanelling of funds) will be consent-based and transparent.

This isn’t just “a black thing”
What we are seeing play out through protests is a natural reaction to pain. We’re witnessing a global acknowledgement of the fact that the gross injustices committed against black people are wrong and anti-human. In Tokyo, France, the United States, the UK , a total of eighteen countries around the world, – people of different nationalities and races are standing in solidarity with black communities to take on the many forms of racism that exist in our corporations, institutions, and political structures. Hashtags and signs saying “I can’t breathe” is not just the cry of black people – it is the cry of the world.
 
WHY DONATE?
Far too many brilliant young men of colour don’t choose to pursue a career in technology—many never even consider it a possibility. Together, we can show them the excitement and viability of entering the computer and technology fields. Together, we can help close the racial divide in the tech industry.
Together, we can make a difference.

1716,every-bit-helps-creating-educational-youtube-tuto,"Every Bit Helps YouTube channel was created in 2017 by my partner and I. The aim was to help newbies to get started in crypto. After trying and failing to buy my first Bitcoin in 2013, I understood how daunting it was to enter the crypto space. So, as my knowledge has grown, I´ve created tutorials along the way, to try to help and hopefully make the process a lot easier for others. 

Every Bit Helps won´t be able to tell you whats going to be the next big thing in Ethereum or fight with other YouTubers to bring you the latest news (you´d be better off checking out the likes of Nugget News), but hopefully will help break down those complicated projects and help to provide a clear explanation on how to use these platforms.

We are still a small team and all the tutorials are researched and recorded by me (with the audio quality getting better) whilst my partner edits. This allows us to keep our overheads to a minimum.



Although, its still a small YouTube channel, 2020 has been a massive (and pretty busy) year for Every Bit Helps, especially with the rapid popularity in DeFi platforms

Views - 2.3 million (November 313k)
Subscribers - 21,000+ (November 2.8k)
Tutorials - 132 (November 18)

Although the numbers above do not represent the amount of views or tutorials created specifically for Ethereum or DeFi Projects, you can check out EveryBitHelps to see that some of our tutorials are the most popular related to some of the biggest DeFI projects such as UniSwap, Aave, Compound etc.



In 2021 we are looking to continue our growth on YT and hopefully build on our online presence with our website EveryBitHelps.co.uk. 

It´s taken a lot of time over the years to create the content for these video tutorials and we hope to continually improve and grow, to provide better content in the future for the community.

Unfortunately the time it takes to create these video tutorials (and look after two small children) doesn't allow us much bandwidth to also create posts to support/compliment our videos. Hopefully in 2021 we will continue to concentrate on creating more video content, whilst outsourcing the written content for our website, which is currently still a ""work in progress"".

2255,karma-social-media-for-good,"Imagine a system that enables someone to wake up everyday, decide how they can improve the life of another, take action immediately and earn a reward when sharing their positive actions with others. Monetary incentive & economic freedom, historically, have been the greatest driving forces to improve both societies as a whole and the quality of life for the individual. Apart from the personal “Karma” one might receive from the ether, there isn’t a tremendous amount of incentive to do good in a world of scarce resources. For billions of people around the globe, opportunities to earn an income are slim. Beyond those scarce opportunities, even fewer of them add tremendous value to the communities in which the individuals live. KARMA believes that if basic human needs are met, it is in our DNA to interact positively with one another.

The KARMA App solves these problems by incentivizing users to have beneficial interactions in the world, post them and receive KARMA by other users up-voting their post. KARMA creates a positive feedback loop between beneficial human interactions and a tokenized incentive. The actions KARMA incentivizes will create an exponential effect of good in the world amongst individuals living in communities. Every single day billions of humans interact with one another. Broadly speaking, the majority of these interactions are positive. Creating a reward system for these actions through tokenization will be the fuel needed for the exponential growth of human good towards one another.

It’s about bridging the gap between users of the platform and beneficiaries of the actions incentivized by the platform. Going a step further, by improving the life of others, you're actually improving the world around you.

Hi Guys.

BitcoinKenny here. I’m a  Singaporean crypto lover/degen. Defi and crypto is wakes me up every single day (and even night). On my articles I share what I learn and help people to discover and invest in such new protocols or start their crypto investment journey.

For that I write guides on how to structure your portfolio for more conservative investors as well as alphas for my fellow degens.

I’m convinced short and sweet communication is essential but my write up are no doubt juicy. I've a special skill of delivering useful information in a easy to understand and quick manner. Many people who read my analysis are able to integrate seamlessly into crypto coming from stocks or forex.

Help me by making the world become a better place by spreading word of how wonderful crypto and Defi is going to be for our world. 

If you want to 
support me, this has been my progress so far.

I created a newsletter/telegram group for my articles (+57  subscribers, not a lot but it’s only been up for 2 weeks)
I previously spent more time on My Twitter account (543 subscribers, increasing at a higher rate than before) but found a large bunch of new crypto investors are not on twitter yet, thus implementing the medium/telegram approach. 
I've written 4 articles and guides and plan to spend more time writing guides on Defi so that newbies are able to benefit from defi in 2021 bull run. 


How I used funds

Paying gas fees so I try out more defi protocols as well as be a degen and ape into more defi projects. (thus a deeper insight into defi)
Fund my expenses so can I can focus on write up so more people can benefit from Defi and Crypto. 

What’s Next ?

Create even more content and reaching out to the community. I want to know what users want so I can adjust my content to make you all happy.
Although I'm creating a grant, I do not actually need this money, it is a way for me to finance what I'm doing in my research to write up even more amazing content for you all.
The number of support in the community and subscribers is a bigger motivator to me than cash.

The game's goal will be to create a global path that would allow a digital nomad to travel around the world without taking an airplane from ecovillage to ecovillage. This map will show a real path. The ecosystem co-creation through the game takes place alongside an open source web-based prototype. Impact Pirates - the game - will help with wiring the ecosystem valueflows to sustain all participants and thrive - whilst actively mapping solutions to reduce CO2 along the way.

Participants playfully learn about Token Engineering and Ecosystem Valueflows course content in a game-based framework, which we call Electric Circus. Playing and building games helps people understand complex systems—including their own systems of thinking.

Insights since our last round:
✨  The ""design x systems thinking"" was too much time thinking and not enough action in the embodiment, for the intentional communities we met
✨ Using learnings from web3, ecovillages can reprogram financial and value flows to help with typical struggles for sustenance. But few showed interest as connecting at global scale beyond web directories looked like a big risk without certain outcome and it appears to be a potential threat to their local values.
✨ Creating yet another web page, map, or directory is not enough to unveil the potential valueflows amongst impact pirates and intentional communities who are building with the intention of reducing CO2 production and increasing prosperity.

MotionDAO and Connecting Art values with Climate values, an initiative by MotionDAO participant Jeanne - who just started out with valueflows but immediately added e-motion to it!
Together with them ""energize"" the valueflows mapping, e.g. Fear of tech, is a huge valueflow blocker obviously in connecting ecovillages with web3 possibilities - but it's not something that participants admit or are aware of; or most of them, on the contrary, underscore that ""industrialization/financialization"" is the very reason they created an alternative with their ecovillages; likewise tech-loving digital nomads can be ignorant to the ""higher values"" around which intentional (virtual or real) communities form and use as their compass to find direction.
Test with Bloom Network: ""absolutely, actually most local bloom organizers describe themselves as energy workers, working with plant teachers and so forth. It's what our logo is a picture of"" - Magenta, who went through TE Academy Ecosystem Valueflows course during our last update.

Here's a first overview of upgrading valueflows with energy metaphors, e.g. ""agents"" and ""biases"" become ""humans"" and ""blocked energies""; ""assumptions"" become ""self-inquiry""  - What difference will those metaphors make? (h/t Fabian for his contributions thus far!)


How do we transform this into a multi-dimensional, energetic valueflows ""map""? - highlighted are the digital nomads from the V/intentional communities mentioned above who are contributing to this round's clarifying question, with following contributions:

The average age of the employees is 27.5. Our mission is “to break through the dilemma of society”, and we focus on “the rapid growth through continuous learning as an individual and as a company” and “the immediate action without fear of failures”.
Now, we’re entering the global market and want much more people to know about our JPYC and its utility as a payment method in the real and the virtual world.
For this reason, we are looking for new members who can communicate in English and love this blockchain industry. You can apply via “Wantedly” or if you can’t understand Japanese you also can reach out to us in DM on Twitter.

JPYC株式会社について

JPYC株式会社は平均年齢が27.8歳のメンバーで構成されているベンチャー企業です。「社会のジレンマを突破する」をミッションとして掲げており、「学び続ける事による急成長」と「失敗を恐れない即行動」を重視しています。
事業としては、JPYC（JPYCoin）という日本円に1:1対応した、Suicaなどのような前払式支払手段形態のステーブルコインを発行しております。

Japan's first Japanese Yen stable coin (ERC20)
 
JPYC (JPYCoin) is Japan's first Japanese Yen stable coin that utilizes blockchain technology (ERC20).
It runs on Ethereum's Mainnet, Polygon, Siden, and xDai Chain, and is always available for buying and selling goods at 1 JPYC = 1 yen. We are planning to add more chains in the future based on feedbacks from users and communities. 
You can use it as a coin denominated in Japanese yen in your wallet such as MetaMask or in the secondary distribution market such as Uniswap.
 
*JPYC is complying with Japanese Law and we’re now treated as “the Prepaid Payment Instruments for Own Business” under the law.

2054,economics-design-education,"TLDR: We want to increase the video and audio quality of these educational content. Seeking $2,500 per month to increase video production quality and audio quality. 

Why we do what we do
Economics Design's Education seeks to educate people in the crypto space about fundamentals. That includes economics, incentive mechanisms, financial economics, to name a few. Ecosystems are the new business models, empowering individuals and creating decentralised organisations for the people, governed by the people. That is transformational.

For the past 1 year, we have been working hard to get the process up and running, and to test the type of content that people are looking for. Now, we can double down on increasing the aesthetic of this, so more people can learn and benefit. 


Why this matters
As we move towards that future, the devil is in the details. What is the economics behind such models? How do we implement and execute it? What are the mathematics and models that allows smart contracts to run? What technology are there and how can we exploit the technology to gain more efficiency? These are some of the things we cover.


Why should you care
Innovation in the crypto, DeFi and tokenisation space is growing at an exponential rate. There is a real cost in lagging behind and not understand what is going on. Thus, Economics Design Education is here to help you to get comfortable with the space.


Who should care
That includes:
retail users who want to understand the economics of various protocols
retail investors who are seeking fundamentals instead of just financial and technical analysis
capital market looking to enter the DeFi space
developers looking for new ideas to innovate upon

What are we doing
In general, we are teaching how to design, analyse and understand the fundamental economics of a protocol. That is based on a simple and easy to digest Economics Design Framework.

Economics Design Education is doing this in a few ways:

Book — highly recommended research book on the economics, mechanisms and math of token economics and DeFi
YouTube — (1) in-depth educational piece on a protocol case study, explaining the mechanisms, incentives and token design (2) explanation of specific tech innovation like ""what is quadratic funding?""
Newsletter — weekly newsletter on a protocol case study or a complicated topic like derivatives financial engineering or DEX math model
Podcast — interviews with podcast developers for users keen on more primary research
Webinars — sessions with leading experts in the space, to discuss topic focused hard questions
Research — (1) weekly research topic via newsletter on finance and fundamental DeFi topics (2) fundamental segment analysis in DeFi
Online course — deep dive into the economics and mechanisms behind how all these systems work

Do people care about this?
TLDR: Yes.
Yes, we are getting great reach and engagement with our educational content.
Main feedback we keep getting: ""your content is high quality. Can you please increase the video quality?""

Numbers to show that instead of people's feedback
Research book: 500 books sold to all 6 continents
YouTube: 15-20% month on month growth, monthly reach of 110k impression and 10k views
Newsletter: 3 types of newsletters for 3 types of individuals, with 50% engagement rates

What we'll do this round of grants?
We aim to get 500,000 subscribers for YouTube and Newsletters in 2021. How? Increasing the video quality.
Hire a video producer → increase the quality of video, editing, animation, visual appeal
Increase the audio quality → mic, audio engineer, materials in the filming space for better acoustic
Continue on the monthly themes of 2021
Active community online to continue the education, between new videos coming out (Probably Discord)
""How to"" videos of how to use various DeFi protocols

How can you help?
Every DAI and ETH you provide goes to increasing the video quality and support the content of the channel!

Thank you so much!

2594,an-advocate-for-the-user-defending-human-rights-i,"Fight for the Future is the most active digital rights nonprofit in the web3 space, building on their decade of advocacy and activism for open source software, privacy, and the democratization of the internet. Their mission is to ensure that technology is a force for empowerment and free expression rather than corruption and inequality. By employing a tactical combination of technology, organizing, alliances, and messaging, Fight harnesses the power of the Internet to mobilize people on an unprecedented scale—and speak to legislators with users’ interests at heart.

In summer 2021, when the Senate added a provision that would threaten the entirety of the cryptocurrency ecosystem to a must-pass bill, Fight launched a massively viral effort at dontkillcrypto.com that brought the entire infrastructure package to a halt. They drove 40,000+ calls to senators and facilitated tweets reaching more than 20 million people, helping to generate the introduction of two competing amendments in less than a week. While the Senate failed to amend their original, harmful language, the campaign succeeded in exploding the issue into the public’s radar, earning more attention to cryptocurrency policy than ever before and demonstrating that Congress will be held accountable for sneaking through bad laws.

Since then, the crypto lobby has exploded—and Fight is a unique voice with a human rights focus. Fight is meeting with dozens of legislators and taking principled and powerful stances on ham-handed legislation, engaging with topics ranging from Russian sanctions to CBDCs. While ruthlessly non-partisan, Fight’s current focus is engaging progressives who share values on human rights, big tech, privacy, and the right to code.

Without a bipartisan base of support, there will continue to be a rush toward new rules or regulations that could kill important technologies in their infancy, and catch essential open source software projects in the crossfire.

Activities - Updated June 2022

Expand the number of civil society organizations speaking out and recruit new constituencies who should be engaged on these issues but currently aren’t. 
Bring web3 projects in on expanded advocacy opportunities that build bridges—advocating for encryption, against financial deplatforming, and in the interest of breaking up big tech. Crypto values don’t exist in a vacuum!
Drive the public relations strategy among peers and progressive legislators. 
Facilitate in-depth conversations to recruit new constituencies.
Speak truth to crypto lobbyists and let them know when they’re getting in their own way.
Call out scams—and demand thoughtful and precise regulation to protect everyday people and crypto projects.
Call out bad legislation and opportunism by demanding better from lawmakers and fellow organizations alike.
Have the hard and direct conversations around why these issues are important for human rights online, and what might get caught in the crossfire of bad regulation, myopic analysis, or harmful business practices.
Rapidly mobilize aggressive advocacy campaigns. 
Assess and sound the alarm for bad legislation that is actually a threat. Rally the troops and produce a steady drumbeat of opposition to the worst legislation through sign-on letters, calls, petition drives, crowdfunded billboards, etc.
Arm supporters with the best tools for rallying others and making their voices heard. 
Develop easy-to-use action tools and share these resources with the coalition. 
Build websites that will serve as campaign hubs.

If you have lupus, you’re at higher risk for infections like the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. Some people with lupus may also be at risk for more serious complications from catching the coronavirus.

Your local health department is the best source of risk information for your area. The situation is changing rapidly. As soon as we are aware of a change in recommendations we will update our information.

The threat the infection poses for people with lupus is higher than the general population. We urge you to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations to protect your health and lower your risk for infection.

What Are We Doing?
Lupus Foundation of America Urges Manufacturers of Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine to Ensure Supply to Treat Lupus

The Lupus Foundation of America is working with medical professionals to actively pursue all avenues to ensure people with lupus have access to the medications and medical care they need, including hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and chloroquine. These drugs are commonly used in the treatment of lupus and are currently under investigation as potential treatments for coronavirus (COVID-19). We support efforts to fast track study of these drugs for COVID-19, but at the same time urge all stakeholders – patients, health care providers, industry, and government — to work together so that those with lupus and other conditions who rely on these drugs continue to have access to them while their potential use in COVID-19 is studied.

For many people with lupus there are no alternatives to these medications. For them, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine are the only methods of preventing inflammation and disease activity that can lead to pain, disability, organ damage, and other serious illness. An increase in lupus-related disease activity not only significantly impairs the health and quality of life of people with lupus but will also place further strain on health care providers and systems in a time of crisis.

Multiverse builds on top of the libp2p and IPFS projects to provide a decentralized code hosting network.
This is what sets the Multiverse project apart from current code hosting solutions.

Decentralized networks shift the power from service providers to the users in the form of data ownership.
Data ownership and data portability are the two core factors that will drive innovation on the Multiverse network.
Switching service providers is completely transparent as none of your data is trapped behind a walled garden.

Additionally, data stored on Multiverse is cryptographically secured allowing first-party integrations with blockchains and smart-contracts.
This will enable new types of monetization for software developers in the future.

AGROFORESTRY
 
Introduction 
Climate change is a fact, and it is widely acknowledged that the world is in the midst of a global warming crisis. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion and land use change have released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which is the primary driver of recent climate change. Land use such as agriculture alone, discharges more than 6 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere each year. Because of the increased severity of climate change impacts in some areas, the consequences have been more severe and disastrous.
In Uganda, Climate change is a serious problem, affecting livelihoods. The country experiences prolonged drought, short and erratic rains which are disastrous and affecting agricultural production the backbone of the country. Also, due to disparities in traditional roles, societal expectations, and livelihoods, men and women are affected differently by climate change. Women account for the bulk of Uganda's population of 23.19 million people. They have lower wages, less access to credit and decision-making power, and less control over resources, all of which make them more vulnerable to climate change. It’s therefore important to consider differences when tackling the issue of climate change. 
Agroforestry/permaculture has emerged as a major instrument in the fight against climate change in recent years. It's a widely accepted answer to the twin problems of climate change and food security. It's one of a number of innovative strategies targeted at increasing production while also assisting in the mitigation of climate change by increasing carbon sequestration and boosting the system's ability to cope with the negative consequences of climate change. This project aims to promote agroforestry/permaculture for climate change mitigation and the development of vulnerable groups' livelihoods, such as women, by planting fruit trees alongside food crops.
Project objectives 
1.     To sensitize stakeholders on the importance of Agroforestry/permaculture
2.     To form groups among communities and train them in agroforestry practices.
3.     Enhance capacity of 500 households in 20 groups raise and plant seedlings on their individual/community farms alley crops.
4.     Establish nursery beds for raising seedlings to supply 64schools and 40 health centers across Tororo District

CLIMATE CHANGE, ECOSYSTEMS AND FORESTS

INTRODUCTION:
Over the past decades, forests were seen as one of the natural resources on Earth but the increasing population and human activity; recently has caused continuous deforestation activity hence we observe change in weather. This may have caused soil degradation and droughts in different parts of Uganda. It is important to carryout a quick interventions to restore the lost forests glory; We have therefore arrived at a solution to plant more extra trees and other measures to tackle the climate crisis.
AYOWECCA UGANDA has launched two million tree planting program to minimize environmental impacts  from tree degradation as well as to improve the nutritional status of the community; mainly shade and fruit trees are to be planted in schools, health centers and Communities in Uganda.
To stimulate domestic increments in forest cover through the establishment of a regional forestry nursery. The target is to plant 10000 plants in the nursery that will be planted in the region.
  Trees contribute a lot to the Environment over along periods by providing oxygen, improving air quality, Climate amelioration, conserving water, preserving soil and supporting wildlife.
We have chosen to grow and plant more trees.
To grow, distribute seedlings and also participate in tree planting.
To plant trees in Schools, health centers and in Communities where we live.
To foster every Ugandan to plant 5-10 trees every year.
To have a nationalisms alert for the Climate Crisis and actions to be taken.
To provide fruits to school children in a short and longer run to reduce starvation at school and reduce Hunger crisis of school going children on empty stomachs and keep them at school.

GOAL: To reduce the impacts of Climate change in Uganda and ensure that the natural environment is used wisely and continues to be available for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations.

Increasing plantation in the project area.
Enhancing the understanding of Climate change issues.
Building the capacities of the community in planting trees and maintaining forest cover to maximize their livelihood generation.
Raising awareness on Climate change/global warming and good security.
To establish and maintain maximum tree cover.
To maintain trees in a healthy condition through good cultural practices.
To establish and maintain an optimal level of age and species diversify.
To promote conservation of tree resources.
To select, situate, and maintain street trees appropriately to maximize benefits and minimize hazard, nuisance, hardscape damage and maintain costs.
To centralize tree management under a person with necessary expertise.
To promote efficient and cost-effective management of the urban and rural forests.
To foster Community support for the local urban forestry program and encourage good tree management on privately owned properties
To facilitate the resolution of tree-related conflicts between citizens.",https://www.ayoweccauganda.org,1274,1282,213,3,0,https://github.com/jjonathanolwenyi,3

866,the-genesis-dao,"“The Genesis DAO is DAOstack’s public-goods engine, aiming to develop and expand the DAOstack ecosystem for the good of the entire DAO space.” Ezra Weller

Until late 2019, the Genesis DAO was funded by DAOstack LTD for testing of its DAO interface Alchemy, of the Holographic Consensus framework, and of experimental areas of DAO governance as well as activities around technical development, research, and evangelism of the DAO stack. 

At the end of 2019, the resignation of DAOstack’s Genesis community facilitation team coincided with significant fragmentation of Genesis DAO community into a decentralized community of specialized DAOs bringing about a period of recess for this historically significant, but no longer funded local commons.  

It has been posited that Genesians were only active when Genesis had steady funding and that without funding Genesis is no longer relevant. Yet, as new DAOs spring up on Alchemy the founding aspiration of expanding the ecosystem for the good of the entire DAO space has not faded. This task has not become any less trivial and Genessians have not become any less ambitious, driven or knowledgeable. The writer believes the community has matured, gotten stronger and has a lot of work ahead of it.

Along with DAOstack LTD and the Genesis DAO, bitfwd community seeks to sponsor a program of work with a view to re-establish, organize and re-vitalize Genesis DAO’s landmark qualities of an on-boarding beacon, safe space, ideas incubator, open society forum and community hub where DAOs get nurtured and where DAOists old and new find opportunities learn, grow and make a difference.

We want to create a constructive environment where blockchain community development and governance can be learned by doing and where shared purpose and collective intelligence of new and seasoned DAOists alike continue the work of experimentation and co-creation of thriving decentralized communities. 

It's time for this once buoyant and active community to find new vitality, new ways of raising funds, exciting experiments to play with and significant goals to accomplish.

The proceeds of this grant will go directly to Genesis DAO and ideally mark the beginning of a revitalization movement that will continue on into the future!

3380,effectiveamlorg-decentralize-knowledge,"Scientists, and even the UN, have declared anti-money laundering rules profoundly ineffective, and harmful to society, yet the AML bubble ignores its own failure and the crypto community is often met with moralizing platitudes. With a PhD in AML and policy effectiveness/outcomes science, a discipline surprisingly rare in the anti-money laundering realm, this project helps break down knowledge silos, democratize AML policy/science, and grow evidence-based resources to counter unfounded AML rhetoric.
 
Problem
Knowledge siloes (AML, crypto, and science bubbles) insulate AML policy from critical assessment from a public interest perspective – despite AML’s puny “success rate” (between 0.05-0.2%, leaving criminals up to 99.95%), constantly expanding regulatory risk, exponential cost, and harm to millions of people, communities, businesses, and countries. 

Simplistic narratives that ""AML stops crime"" and must be applied uncritically to crypto often don't stack up.

Did you know, for example, that the industry set up in 1990 claiming to ""fight"" money laundering, crime, and terrorism, stopped even trying to assess any impact of its ""comply with rules based on standards"" mantra in about 1991, and does not even collect data to prove any impact on money laundering, crime, or terrorism? Scientists have been highlighting such failings since at least 1994.
 
However, unaware of these problems, the crypto community often argues crypto definitions and scope, while AML’s kryptonite (its own profound failures) remain hidden, and bad regulations constantly expand without facing up to, let alone fixing, AML’s own core problems.
 
Simplistic “crypto bad, AML good” narratives, despite shared objectives (no-one wants crime), chill meaningful debate and risk one-size-fits-all regulations (and failure, harm, and costs spiraling) rather than smarter, effective, solutions.

The standardized AML response to failure is constantly to demand more regulations, more data, imposing more cost. Without access to the science and evidence, often behind academic paywalls, it is hard to counter that narrative. Yet AML is so astonishingly ineffective that cutting crime with less surveillance, fewer regulations, less complexity, less compliance, less harm, and less cost, is not only feasible but imperative.
 
Solution
Break down knowledge barriers with the only blog about anti-money laundering effectiveness curated by someone with a PhD in policy effectiveness/outcomes/AML, quoted in US Senate testimony, The Economist, Forbes, Politico, Reuters, and more, describing the AML system as possibly the least effective anti-crime measure, ever.
 
Help fund accessible evidence-based resources in a critical area to help advocate more effective, less harmful, regulations. AML will have a massive impact in shaping the future, for better or worse. This grant seeks to build free content and pay forward opportunities like subscriptions for crypto advocates, and more resources (including connections to academic literature in an area frequently unfamiliar to AML practitioners and policymakers and often unknown to those in others areas affected by AML, and enabling more artwork to be commissioned to convey key concepts with clarity and impact, etc); to help advance powerful, evidence-based, conversations - for a better future.
 
Help decentralize and democratize research hidden in the science bubble, masked by the AML bubble, unknown in the crypto bubble. 

For just a few of the topics that may be explored, to help reveal fundamental problems with the AML narrative, grounded in science: About that first story and future possibilities.

Plus a few examples appearing in and drawn from academic peer-review journals:
 
·  AML is ineffective: UN 2011, Pol 2018a, 2019a, 2020a (summarized in the blog, in a single paragraph, in the style of The Onion, here - illustrating that the AML narrative compared with the science has reached the point of satire. In many areas, the rhetoric simply does not accord with the evidence).
·  AML is harmful: Pol 2019b, 2020b, 2020c, UN 2021.
·  AML “effectiveness” ratings system is not a viable effectiveness framework: Pol 2018b, 2020.
·  AML fails even to collect relevant data (Levi 2018) or adequately use its own data: Pol 2019c, 2020d.

NFTs providing governance rights to their holders ;
Tokenized carbon certificates, providing tokenized carbon to the carbon offset economy.

We are an international non-profit organization that connects the world of blockchains, compagnies, citizens and environmental organizations to get the funds needed to protect nature.

Have a look at our pitch deck presentation.

Safeguarding green areas is needed to tackle the following challenges : climate change adaptation and biodiversity degradation.

Bloomeria partners with existing environmental organizations that create natural reserves. This enables those organizations to access new sources of funding, in cryptocurrency. Bloomeria is going to mint NFTs on Polygon and sell them on OpenSea to finance protected areas. NFTs contains the following information :

Project geographical datas ;
CO2 estimate of carbon sequestration  ;
biotic index ; 
Bloomeria global governance voting rights ;
Project voting rights (if applicable).



Bloomeria also enables citizens to raise funds and manage their own protected areas thanks to Bloomeria’s tools. Our project is linked to a legal structure in the physical world (we are an international non-profit organization).

Bloomeria is a service platform. It will provide fundraising tools, collaborative management instruments, administrative simplification, as well as the increased visibility stemming from its international network.

What did we achieve since Gitcoin Grant 13 ?
We are working on the CO2 problematic and we wrote 2 articles : ""The problem with tokenized carbon"" and ""A crypto native carbon tokenization process"".
We are selling our first NFTs to support RM.Terra, a Portuguese organization that creates Food Forests and fights climate change. 
We are developing our next project with Tribes and Natures Defenders Inc. who's buying land to safeguard the Rainforest and ancient tribes in the Philippines.

What are our next steps ?
Web3 and app development ;
Build the DAO ; 
CO2 tokenization.

What do we need money for ?
Bloomeria's community is asking us to prioritize web3 and app development. Our team of 3 people has been working part time as volunteer since the launch of Bloomeria in January 2021, but we need to be able to pay a blockchain engineer to make sure Bloomeria grows, develops and answers wishes of our DAO. This way, our blockchain engineer could free up the time needed to:

 Chess. Crypto. Cultivation
LOCATION: McNichols Civic Center Building  (Denver, CO)
ADDRESS: 144 W Colfax Ave, Denver, CO 80202
DATE & TIME: October 1st, 2021 (6PM - 9PM MST)
	
OUR VISION:  We empower the culture with resources & education through strategic development that propel us in the social, economical, business and political realms. Our mission is to inspire those we encounter. We create strategies for marginalized communities to become self-determined. End Game Association’s (EGA) vision and reach expands far beyond the competitive chess board. After the success of our prior chess tournaments, EGA has continued to position themselves alongside creative visionaries, committed community liaisons and resource-rich stakeholders. EGA is not only about seizing the opportunity to empower our communities financially from NFT’s & Crypto, but to also acquire and disseminate knowledge and training around the subjects at our chess tournaments in physical spaces to further nurture the intimate bond that makes us a local community. 

STATEMENT OF INTENT: End Game Association will facilitate one monthly project for 3 months to bring more artists into the DeFi community to explore innovative collaborations between physical artists and blockchain technology. We would like to host our 5th chess tournament at McNichols Civic Center Building, located in Denver, CO. Through strategic community gatherings, we organize artists, activists, creatives, civic minded people, educators & entrepreneurs with various experiences to navigate through life with strategy. We provide programs that include: art, chess, financial literacy, youth mentoring & access to resources for those in need. We aspire to influence leaders that are driven to make a difference. EGA is truly helping to establish themselves by becoming part of Denver’s rapidly emerging/evolving fin-tech ecosystem. We are inviting 16 artists in which we would be minting NFTs of custom chess boards that are ready to be minted.  There are currently 6 boards ready to be minted. The artists will also create a canvas piece live at the event, and those pieces would also be minted on the blockchain.  The games of the chess tournament will be captured live on video & photo and could also be minted on the blockchain. We would also like to invite more artists to customize & submit their custom chess boards so that we could mint them & also pay them for their production time & artistry.
 
ABOUT THE PROJECT: The CyberPanther Party is a generative art NFT project with a focus on activism built using ERC721 and governed through DAO code.  There are a total of 10,000 Panthers that are randomly generated using a verified script.  Although there are different levels of rarity, all the NFTs allow the members to become members of the party. With so much representation of the cyberpunks movement, we felt like civil rights and human rights movements are not being represented in our crypto communities.  These historic movements need to be represented and honored on the blockchain.  After all, we all need our rights to be honored. Activism is usually targeted by big corporations and corrupt people that want to oppress others.  This is a main reason why making our party on the blockchain using DAO methods is a revolutionary way to make sure our voices will never be silenced or censored.  This project is created to bring and highlight the struggle for civil and human rights for people of color and all of those who are oppressed.  Members of the party have a lot of benefits.  Those include, but are not limited to, 1 vote per wallet for DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), access to the Activist Bail Fund, Scholarships, Grants, Exclusive Merch, as well as access to the Chapter (an art canvas that members can draw on).  Add on, the NFT will act as an admission ticket to real life physical events as well as virtual ones.  50% of the original sales from the NFT will be locked for the Panthers Fund in a publicly disclosed wallet address, which is the pool of liquidity for the perks mentioned above.

GenFT enables artists to easily create a collection of NFT using generative art. Patrons can mint an NFT from the collection by completing a proof-of-work puzzle. This ensures randomness in the art that is created.

What is generative art?
In a nutshell, its art where the artist doesn't produce the final work. Instead the artist defines a set of assets, an algorithm, and the parameters used to create the final art. Each individual piece of art is created by generating a unique combination of parameters. The assets are combined and/or modified by the algorithm according to the parameters. We refer to the initial set of parameters as the genome.

An outside influence is used to set the parameters. Generally, the outside influence is random, but it can be anything that has a complex structure that creates a sense of experiential unpredictability. Outside influences range from random or pseudorandom numbers, chemical structures, math formulas, data sets, mechanical processes like the wind, and many more.

The medium of the generated art can be any artistic medium. It is often visual art or music, but can extend into architecture, literature, and other areas of creativity.

To explore these ideas further, the following Wikipedia pages are a good place to start:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art

GenFT uses a classic proof of work problem to act as a source of entropy for the parameters. We refer to this as the DNA of the individual pieces in a collection.

Studios
Studios are editors where an artist specifies the genome of their collection. The artist uploads the components of the generated works and specifies how they can be combined and/or modified. Once complete, the genome is bundled and stored on IPFS.

Pixel Editor Studio
The pixel editor studio was built during the NFTHack hackathon in March, 2021. With it, an artist can define a set of image assets using a pixel editor and define color adjustments. The resulting NFTs are low-res, cartoonish characters similar to CryptoPunks and MoonCats. The sample collection we created is called MoonOwls. It creates low res versions of an owl character that are similar in appearance to MoonCats.

Image Layer Studio

The image layer studio was built at the Web3 Weekend hackathon in May, 2021. An artist can upload a set of images that are layered into a single image. The component images are selected and positioned according to the DNA. The example collection that we built uses eyes, mouths, and face shapes inspired by emojis.

Future studios
The next studio will probably be music oriented. The artist will specify tracks that are selected and combined into a release according to the DNA. Artists can also specify variances in pitch, tempo, timbre, among other things.

Studio SDK
Studios can be created by anyone in the community and submitted for inclusion in GenFT. We also plan to support a way for any Studio to be used with the GenFT studio platform without permission.

Other proposed studios

We have considered implementing a few different types of generative art:

Snowflakes
Inspired by Vivian Wu's snowflake generator, we considered building an NFT generator for animated snowflakes. With about 64 bits of entropy, we can create a large number of beautifully animated snowflakes, each of them unique.



Royal Titles
We considered generating royal titles and a corresponding coat-of-arms. The titles are based on real historic titles and ones from fictional worlds. So you might end up buying a title like ""The Guardian of York"" or ""Duke of Nogrod"". Coats-of-arms would be generated from common elements typical of coats-of-arms with a randomized color scheme.

Minting
In order to mint a token from a collection, the patron will connect a minting page for the collection. The proof-of-work engine starts running when they land on the page. It is similar to the classic PoW algorithm used by Bitcoin. It works by locating a hash that is less than the 

Escalating Price
The artist can define a fixed price or an escalating price for their collection. When the collection is created, a minting price is set and optionally, an incremental price increase. Each additional NFT minted increases the price of the next token minted by the price increment. This ensures that earlier buyers get the best available price for tokens in the collection.

Rarity (Not implemented)
Rare instances can be introduced into a collections in two ways: A feature can be made less likely to trigger from the random DNA than other features, or additional mining can be completed when the token is minted. In the former case, rare features are added to the collection by the artist. In the latter case, the rarity is created by the buyer. It may also be interesting to create a hybrid of this where certain features can only be activated when more mining is submitted with the minting request.

Burn baby burn (Not implemented)
Optionally, an artist can allow tokens to be burned to recover a portion of the last purchase price. A token owner can choose to burn their token to get a percentage of the last price that was last paid for a token. For example, imagine that an artist sets the burn refund to 50%. Say you bought a token for 0.001 Ether and a few hundred have been sold since then. Maybe the last one that sold went for 0.1 Ether. You can choose to burn your token and collect 50% of the last purchase price (0.05 ETH), realizing a 50x profit. This allows a price discovery market to emerge where minting tokens causes the price to rise and burning them causes the price to fall.

When this feature is active, funds to pay for any future burns will need be reserved in the contract and invested to produce recurring revenue that will be paid to the artist.

Revenue Sharing
In order to ensure the ongoing viability of GenFT Studios, we plan to take a small commission from all minting revenue. Additionally, to encourage the development and integration of studio plugins by the community, creators of studio plugins will also be able to add a small commission.

We also plan to implement a way for artists to allow the artist to pay their commission with tokens from the collection. Details TBD.

3945,the-alliance-for-longevity-initiatives,"The Alliance for Longevity Initiatives is the first and only 501(c)(4) organization advocating politically on behalf of the longevity industry. A4LI’s mission is to advance legislation and policy that aims to increase healthy human lifespan, with a focus on accelerating access to next-generation therapies. The “longevity” industry includes biotechnology companies focused on creating drugs and therapies aimed to increase healthy human lifespan. 

Why support longevity policy reform efforts in the US?  
 
The “longevity” industry has exploded over the last decade. Scientists and investors quickly came to the realization that medically treating cellular aging as a way to combat the onset of the morbidities of late-life (and thus, extending healthy lifespan) is both feasible and desirable. That is why an increasing number of biotechnology companies are being established with the goal  committed to increasing healthy human longevity through treating cellular aging.

The U.S. government has the largest budget in the world and sets the policies and regulations that most of the longevity companies in existence have to abide by. Unfortunately, despite realizing that roughly 70% of daily deaths are caused by aging and the diseases associated with cellular aging, the U.S. government only commits about .007% of its budget to study and treat the root biological causes of aging. A key purpose of the government is to protect the lives of its citizens, so this is clearly an immoral allocation of the US government's budget. The US government also has a fiscal responsibility to combat aging. The ""longevity dividend"" is the term used to describe the long-term healthcare savings and increased population productivity society will experience from investing in keeping people in better health for longer through preventative longevity medicines and therapies.

In order for companies that create these aging drugs and therapies to succeed, the US government must be a strategic partner and ally to the industry at large and at the moment, they are not. If we want to unlock the US government’s $4 trillion budget for biomedical aging research and reform regulations to allow companies whose mission involves increasing healthy human lifespan to thrive, the establishment of a robust political advocacy organization (The Alliance for Longevity Initiatives) is absolutely critical.

What the funds from this grant will achieve.

This grant will go towards the development of A4LI’s online educational resource platform on its website, a4li.org, known as A4LI’s “Public Outreach Online Project for Longevity Education."" A4LI will rely on online outreach as the main way to educate policymakers on the progress in the geroscience/regenerative medicine field, and how to best support advancements. A4LI’s website will be the hub of longevity-focused political events, where we will host regular virtual canvassing events to further support pro-longevity candidates/legislation. A4LI will also produce content on its website to supplement its political efforts. A4LI’s main focus for 2021 is to build a psychographic profile politicians database to fast-track future advocacy efforts. This data will generate a corresponding public-facing politician “longevity score” to further encourage agenda  alignment. By 2022, A4LI intends to also launch a podcast, organize focus groups/public polls and host a political action conference, and will rely on the website to promote all these features.


Why should you contribute?

You should contribute because you...

a) want humans to live healthier, longer lives,
 
b) comprehend that the US government has the potential to fund research and discovery for longevity therapeutics at a scale unmatched by any billionaire or company, 

c) realize that a majority of the private drug discovery companies that are creating the drugs that will help treat aging and age-related diseases are subject to US regulations, 

d) understand that a political advocacy effort is necessary to make policymakers and legislators aware of i) why longevity science is important, ii) real-time progress in the longevity space and iii) policy changes that will best support the creation, and equitable distribution of longevity therapies for all and 

e) recognize the necessity for a strong online presence as a tool for any grassroots, political advocacy effort or movement.

I reworked the project idea entirely:

I am going instead of the below do as described in this GitCoin issue.

User Story:
Components and fundamental science discoveries authors receive little money.
Their projects are not enough advertised, among other reasons because software writing and promouting skills are often disjoint and authors may have not enough money to invest.
More SEO for GitCoin.co would be useful.
Acceptance Criteria
 GIVEN we agree on the amounts shared to promouters and to dependencies.
 WHEN we agree on the amounts shared to promouters and to dependencies.
 THEN write code.
Possibly, this feature request should be split into two: about dependencies and about promouters.
Tech Details:
 To everybody who donated to a project's grant allocate a (fixed) share of future donations from projects that refer to that project (proportional to the amount of donation). This solves the problem of underfinanced components.
Determining referring projects can be automated using APIs of services like pypi.org or crates.io (I realize that it requires substantial computing power.)
Reward these who lead to a GitCoin grant (who led is to be determined by a referral code in URL parameter) by a (fixed) share of future donations from projects that refer to that project. This solves the problem of advertising grants. It also gives more promoting to GitCoin.co site as a whole.
On GitCoin sites and our advertising network(s) display paid banners advertising grants (with referral codes to give back to advertisers). Banners should be selected by auctions.
This way we create (yet small) venture capital (SEO) business for advertising grants. It offloads advertising their grants from authors to professional marketers ruled by the market.
Allow anyone to create a copy of a (his or somebody other's) grant page with different text to try different SEO or different landing page conversion rate. It is especially useful for our ""venture capitalists"".
Open Questions:
 How much to allocate to promouters? (Allocation to promouters should be high, for them to be able to reinvest, and also to solve the main open source problem - underpromouted projects.)
How much to allocate to dependencies?
Notes/Assumptions:
 Google repeatedly claims that duplicated text is not a per-se problem for SEO, so allowing our ""venture capitalists"" to create different versions of the same grant landing page should not be a problem.

Clay ""classic liquidité asset yield"" is a decentralized, marco-fractional UBI stablecoin. Clay coin is an innovational, algorithmic stablecoin network thesis for zero interest open banking decentralized network. The Clay Tokken Network is an Austrian cryptoeconomic network that leverages two algorithmic stablecoins (Clay and Couré) to discover price stability and absorb external economic shocks. Clay is a boutique designer token engineered as a minimalist Ethereum Defi network token. Clay is engineered for zero interest, classical financial markets in geographical regions that do not have access classical finance and zero-interest banking. Clay Defi network is inspired by Austrian economics. Clay is a p2p token. The first high, gravity stablecoin. High gravity because it levitates but is not 1:1 with the USD or $DAI. But instead holds a fractional value of the UBI. Clay maintains its price efficiency ratio via a basket of Clay UBI indices.

370,ltokens-solving-the-paradox-between-staking-defi,"LTokens: Solving the paradox between Staking & DeFi 

How LTokens provide liquidity from staked PoS assets, enabling innovative new DeFi products  🚀

StakeDAO is developing a novel way to leverage staked assets locked inside the StakeDAO platform as collateral by issuing LTokens that can be leveraged in external DeFi markets. By providing simultaneously liquidity to both the PoS security and the DeFi services, inefficiencies of overcollateralized capital can be removed, enabling further financial products.

What are LTokens? 🤔

When you stake an asset through the DAO, you can mint a corresponding LToken in a 1:1 peg. For example, if you stake 1 LPT you'll receive 1 LLPT in return.

The newly minted L can be used with any of the existing DeFi tools and services available in the ecosystem, e.g. leveraged staking, collateral into DeFi pools, hedging, trading.

The first liquid asset supported by the LToken mechanism will be Livepeer’s LPT token. Since LPT has a 7 day unbonding period, LLPT tokens will be able to be liquidated for the underlying LPT accordingly.The LLPT tokens obey the follow rules:

The principal collateral (e.g. 1 LPT) will be accessible 7 days (locking period) after the LLPT liquidation function is called.
The staking rewards earned on the LPT collateral will be continually accessible via a payInterest() function (which will issue the interest as newly minted LLPT).
The Stake DAO SCT token  (that allows anyone to claim future Stake DAO cashback  and grants pro-rata governance rights) will be claimable via an LLPT function also.
The ETH fees (from Livepeer transcoding fees) will not be accessible to LLPT token holders, instead they will be able to access ETH fees via the SCT token they will be entitled to (see the Stake DAO Light Paper for more details on this SCT issuance mechanism).


Stake DAO is a revenue-sharing organization, enabling DAO token holders to continuously receive staking rewards and participate in key decision making processes via pro-rata governance rights.

NFT Price Floor is a Coingecko-style data hub and analytics platform. We help you get the price floor, sales data, trading volume, and historical price chart of your favorite collections.

👉 Why did we build NFT Price Floor?

The current creator economy relies on centralized social networks/content distribution platforms (Web 2.0) that extract value and have the ability to censor users.

Web3 will disrupt this model using NFTs as monetization vehicles, allowing the creator economy to grow
unrestricted.

In the future, NFTs will be a part of everyday life, so we thought that the community deserved a nice dashboard to keep track of the markets!


💪 We aim to be the gateway for anyone interested in NFTs, providing a reliable data source for investors to make informed decisions, as well as educational resources for newcomers - everything is freely available for everyone!

👉 What does GR14 mean for us?

🛠 As you know, we are a self-funded project, so every Wei you donate means a lot for our journey. The funds received in the last GR13 helped us launch:

- New underlying infra to improve the performance of our site and scale the number of collections we support. 

- Cross-marketplace data aggregator to make sure we always display the actual floor price of your preferred collections. Besides OpenSea, we are already fetching data from LooksRare, with many more integrations on the way.

- A revamped front-end with an improved search bar to enhance your search experience, and our new filter feature to help you compare data of different NFT projects based on multiple criteria (collection, category, creator, chain) 👇




- Our goal is to make NFT data accessible to everyone, for that reason, we added multi-language support. From now on, NFT Price Floor is also available in Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, Russian, Italian, Indonesian, Dutch, Turkish, with more languages coming soon :)

- With the front-end revamp comes a cool new feature: General Market Metrics. You'll be able to quickly check the number of collections we support and their Floor Cap as a proxy of the overall market capitalization. Expect charts and more general market metrics in the next iteration!

- On top of Ethereum, we are now aggregating data from Polygon-based NFT collections and we plan to add other L2 solutions like Arbitrum.
 

🏀 We believe the NFT market will soon experience a process of financialization via multiple DeFi-like protocols with a focus on digital collectibles, crypto art, and gaming items as a new form of collateral. 
That's why besides acting as a reliable source of truth - an open and free information hub -, we plan to become an actual protocol/marketplace aggregator to help you manage your NFT portfolio 👀 

What are we working on right now / in what areas of development will your donations be spent?

- Enhanced charts (whole price floor history)
- API

SocialBlocks.io offers talented underprivileged kids high-level training to develop blockchain-based solutions, meeting the growing global demand for developers at innovative companies worldwide and providing young people an income which is separate from the economy they live in. It is based on Cryptocurrency and not issued by a central bank.
 
AVADO wants to support SocialBlocks.io by providing the infrastructure and an incentive model for these students to improve their chances of earning enough money to have a sustainable income one day. 
With the money raised from this grant, AVADO will send Blockchain Computers (https://ava.do/avado-i3) to Brazil. Instead of the 735 USD we usually ask, we will lower the cost to 415 USD and this will include shipping to Brazil and all taxes.
 
SocialBlocks.io will distribute the Computers and ensure that they are properly installed and used. The best part is that most of the underprivileged communities in Brasil  have high speed internet access and lower costs for electricity.
This makes Running an AVADO box less expensive and provides access to many different Blockchains at a click of a button. In addition, AVADO has created a DAppstore that showcases Smart Mining applications that rent out your hardware (CPU, Storage, Bandwidth, etc.) and allow you to earn crypto simply by running this machine. This allows the young generation to change to a new economy without having to leave their family.
 
Your contribution will help the young generation in the Brazilian underprivileged communities to
Access the blockchain
Earn cryptocurrency by running the machine
 
At this moment AVADO Users already can earn up to 50 USD by running the Mysterium Package and also earn a 0.1% commission on every transaction if they add their Tornado Cash package to the RYO Cloud. Over time more Smart Mining DApps will be added opening more opportunities for users to earn crypto. 
Hopefully, some kids from the SocialBlocks.io program will create their own Blockchain DApps and have them run on AVADO.
 
Here is what we do with your contribution:
Every time the contributions, in addition to the quadratic funding, reach 415 USD we can give one box to Socialblocks.io 
At the end of the funding round, we hope to give several boxes to SocialBlocks.io

Participants can innovate new products and services without traditional cost challenges.


Mutualization of risk: risk is supplied by multiple parties that are sanctioned by the risk profile owner. The party might be a legal authority, or some organization (the gym, doctor, your job), or an IoT device (health tracker, your car). The mutual result will have lower redundancy in the digital profile and complete in comparison to traditional methods.

Transactional risk: owners can share or transact a part of their own risk. Upon request, some data is shared with an interested party (insurer or a business partner) if/when the holder wants.

The two above result is somewhat new and crazy use cases. For instance, the risk profile might be used as a form of trust for a ‘voting power,’ allowing the holder to take an acting role in the insurance claim resolution or other managing function. Or, letting a parent who carries high trust due to his driving behavior vouching for their kids and cutting down their monthly premium. Or, allowing a group of friends to add to a shared risk pool and build up a trusted community with the financial benefit of each participant. Or, you use your own transactable risk as a form of collateral asset, which gets locked (and possibly even burned) in return for another digital asset.

Finally, there might be a form of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) instrument that generates a substantial profit as a return for the invested risk.
At the very least, the self-sovereign risk will lead to a better/cheaper custom-tailored pricing model for an individual. Additionally, fearless security with no dependence on FAANG or any other third-party datacenter.

The risk carriers will have a live helicopter view on their customers’ base risk, allowing them to run the financial reports ad-hoc. In fact, customers don’t have to reveal much data for businesses to analyze risks ‘en masse.’ Instead, Blockchain storage can have a zero-knowledge principle embedded, disclosing only ‘conditional’ datasets and these datasets are only tied to an address with a key. All these might be rather a game-changer for the regulatory reporting and Solvency regulation.

The Marma J Foundation Grant aims to grow community projects and businesses, with a focus on social and economic prosperity. By redistributing wealth towards projects, community groups, and businesses that align with the Marma J Foundation mission, our goal is to build strong communities that support underrepresented and/or disadvantaged individuals.

Our DAO

The Marma J Foundation manages assets on Ethereum (marmaj.eth) and on NEAR (marmaj.near).


The Marma J DAO exists with the purpose of supporting creatives who aim to spread love and positivity throughout the web3 community. Currently, the Marma J SputnikDAO is where the Marma J Council Members (bianca.near, chloe.near, rebecca.near) vote on proposals submitted on the NEAR blockchain. Each proposal to the Marma J SputnikDAO also requires a Discourse Forum link upon submission. We currently plan to use the NEAR Governance Forums for this process.

PREVIOUS GRANT ROUNDS

Round 10: Gitcoin Grant x Marma J Foundation CTD Recap


Let's send some people to University!

Long story short, we've been building the foundations of the Marma J Foundation for a little while now, and we are finally at a point where we may be able to expand into some larger projects.

Funds raised in this grant round will be set aside to support students attending the University of the West Indies Five Island Campus. Each of the academic programs has a tuition fee of $1800 per year of instruction. The goal of this grant (GR10) is to be able to fully support the computer science education of at least one individual. Future plans for the foundation entail a vibrant and active local community of web3/open web creators in Antigua, so this is our actionable step forward.

Funds raised for this initiative will be pooled at antigua.near and staked until a viable candidate is found to allocate the funds to. 

Gitcoin Grants Round 9 - Project Supported: Friends of the Care Project / Friends Development Center


In this short video (8 mins), you can hear from Chloe Lewis, the founder of the Marma J Foundation, as she explains the goals for Gitcoin Grants Round 9. The funds raised from this round will be used to purchase art supplies for the students at the Friends of the Care project.

2307,deep-nfts-machine-learning-for-nft-space,"This project seeks to expand the application of generative Machine Learning models to NFTs. Using ML we can transfer styles from existing NFTs and mint new NFTs with unique features and traits derived from the model's custom parameters and parent NFTs.

How Does it Work?

You have two NFTs like Hashmasks or CryptoPunks.
Select one NFT as a content object and the other one as a style object or use two NFTs as style objects.
Run pretrained ML model in your browser to transfer and/or combine styles between NFTs using custom settings such as stylization ratio. 
Mint a new NFT on the blockchain. Minted NFTs persist unique data about ML parameters and settings used to create them on blockchain. NFTs inherit rarity and unique properties from their parent NFTs.



State of the Project

We have a working demo of the style transfer process applied to NFT images
Work on smart contracts and wallet integrations is in progress (Ethereum/Polygon, Binance Smart Chain)
We are planning integration of multiple ML models including state-of-the-art GANs and experimenting with other innovative use cases for NFT generation using machine learning

What: Our mission is to create a resource for those who are interested in learning more about Ethereum Money games. We hope MoneyGames.info will serve as a guide, explorer, and news source for those who are interested in Ethereum Money games. In addition, we hope to help evaluate the legitimacy of the varying Money Games by eventually creating a Money Games rating system.

Why: We believe Money Games will be a significant part of the new financial landscape that Ethereum is building. At the moment, the number of Money Game players is small and concentrated. While we believe we can be a great resource for serious Money Game players, we also hope to be a bridge to help bring non-crypto users into the Ethereum ecosystem.

Goal: Build a trusted source of Ethereum Money Games information.

Development Plan
Our goal to raise a grant for each individual phase of development. Ideally, we start with a small grant, then build out from there as the community of supporters verifies the completion of each phase. This will allow us to take feedback along the way and adjust accordingly.

Phase 1 ($1,000): Acquire relevant domain names, develop a brand for MoneyGames.info, design a basic shell for the website and load with a few of the current Money Games, launch MoneyGames.info. 

Phase 2: If phase 1 is successful (phase 1 grant raised and phase 1 completed), we will then launch a phase 2 grant that will aim to bring the entire Money Games ecosystem into MoneyGames.info. 

Phase 3: After a successful phase 2, we then begin offering commentary on the current Money Games landscape (macro and micro). This will include articles, videos, and guest writers. Possibly an additional paid content creator.

Phase 4: Create the Money Games rating system.

Who Am I?
I’m like a combination of Herm Edwards and Doug Funny. And, I don’t like to talk about my anon self. See my comments on Twitter I suppose. But, I will say, I am an avid fan and user of Ethereum, and have been for the past 3-4 years. I love to build things; pergolas, relationships, brands, websites, communities…those sorts of things. 

I’m looking for where I can add value to this amazing Ethereum community, and building MoneyGames.info is the way for me to do that.

How you query blockchain data?

Checking explorers? Using APIs? Creating your own small tool?

Do you think the whole process sucks?

Don’t worry; we are going to change that. Let me introduce Bitquery Editor.

With Bitquery Editor, we are changing the way how developers work with blockchains data.

Using our Bitquery editor, developers can create GraphQL queries to use them as APIs. You can also share queries with anyone; for example, check this GraphQL query for the top 10 DEX trades based on USD amount.

Developers will able to save their queries and share them with team members or publicly. And use them directly in their applications as APIs. In addition, we are building ‘Flexigraph,’ which will allow developers to expand our schema by joining multiple queries and other techniques.

We also plan to enable visualization through drag and drop charts building using the query results, helping analysts and data scientists visualizing blockchain data.
Our editor and queries will be powered by Bitquery Infra, where we currently process more than 160 TB of blockchain data.

Bitquery editor is open-source, and we plan to make it a universal GUI tool for working with blockchain data for developers, analysts, and data scientists.

								Cryptocurrency Markets:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are a number of rebalancing services/tools available on the market, each claim to provide reduced risk (measured in terms of volatility) to cryptocurrency portfolios and each claim to provide various levels of generated alpha.

Nescience offers the same as any competitors and more, at no up front cost to users.

Most important, our tool is the only solution that stores API keys completely client side. Smaller investors and those with a high risk tolerance may accept third party API custody, but given the many recent controversies surrounding the exploitation of security flaws in similar services, we see such risks as unnecessary and unacceptable.

A demo is available 24/7 at : https://www.twitch.tv/nesciencesoftware/
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								Traditional Markets:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The average investor is charged about $500 per year in Index Fund maintenance fees. Nescience plans to disrupt this aging status quo.

With the widespread transition to free trades across the industry, an investor can completely avoid these unnecessary fees by creating a direct index through the Alpaca Exchange. 

Further, with our upcoming IRA compatible Etrade/Ally integration, an investor of any aptitude will be able to completely replace Index Funds in their retirement portfolio, all while retaining custody of their funds and API keys.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								Funding:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To this date we have completely self-funded our project and have yet to take funding or revenue from outside sources. Our goal is to simply provide the community with the tools necessary to responsibly & safely manage their portfolio. 

Our current development is focused primarily on extending our integration to IRA compatible exchanges, while we maintain and update any depreciated API endpoints on currently integrated exchanges.

Any funding received will be used to pay a freelance animator/voice actor to create a product demonstration/explanation video, as we see product comprehension as the most important aspect of adoption. Any excess funding will be used to pay for bug bounties.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I personally believe that Direct Indexing will be the one of the most impactful financial technologies of the coming years as investors begin to move away from traditional index funds, and hope that the community feels the same way.

If you cannot contribute monetarily, please take some time to just check out the product and see if it could save you money. We also appreciate any other forms of contribution! We are specifically looking for non-US citizens that are willing to test our Upbit & OkEx integrations!

1641,dao-internal-dispute-resolution-open-handbook-by-,"As DAOs have proliferated they have begun to take on bigger projects, their communities have grown, and we've noticed an increase in the number of incoming questions to LexDAO regarding effective dispute resolution within DAOs, between DAOs, and beyond. We believe that if ""rage kick"" (or any DAO stack's equivalent) exists we need to articulate a fair process of communication and escalation to deploy before it happens. (In the law we call this ""due process."")

If sufficiently funded this grant we will produce an open source handbook for internal disputes: processes, procedures, and technology to handle disputes between members of a DAO.

We are seeking grant funding to research, write, and publish a handbook. We will adapt existing dispute resolution and mediation best practices for the DAO context based on research into specific DAO structures and emergent technology.

Funds:
Goal ~ $5000 would cover LexDAO resources to produce a serviceable handbook based on best practices and emergent tech solutions.

Additional funds raised will allow us the bandwidth to expand research by incorporating discovery sessions with a broader range of existing DAOs. This will allow us to flesh out the handbook with greater specificity.

About LexDAO:
LexDAO is a (the?) Web3 Legal Engineer's Guild, we're a DAO in a non-profit co-op legal wrapper, summoned to establish standards for legal engineering. We write code, do research, and train legal engineers.

The LexDAO Mission:
""LexDAO is a non-profit association of legal engineering professionals that brings the traditional legal settlement layer to code, and coded agreements to the masses. We believe that everyone deserves access to justice provided in a quick and efficient manner. If legal services were easier to use, verify, and enforce, we could live in a fairer world. Blockchain technology offers solutions to many problems in the legal space. Our mission is to research, develop and evangelize first-class legal methods and blockchain protocols that secure rules and promises with code rather than trust. We do this by training LexDAO certified legal engineers and buidling LexDAO certified blockchain applications. We strive to balance new deterministic tools with the equitable considerations of law to better serve our clients, allies, and ultimately citizens.""

Acting similar to traditional insurance, Terminal has no middle-men, hence low cost, transparency and inclusion.

How it works
- people lock the digital asset/ETH agains a particular trip they're about to take
- the payout is calculated on-chain
- the buyer takes the trip and when (if) the trip is delayed the payout happens automagically with no manual claim needed

But there is also another use case when people can join the risk capital reserves and earn perpetual interest on their deposit.
The vaults of Terminal mimic the traditional institutional reserves which are backing up risks:
operational

Both those funds hold the reserves in a number of assets and rebalance automatically.

The Decentralized Future is People

Cryptocurrency Jobs is on a mission to enable talented humans and companies to work together and build our decentralized future.

Building this future takes people, from developers and researchers to designers and writers, working together.

Cryptocurrency Jobs is here to help people find their path in the crypto space.

Story

I usually don't share much about what happens behind the scenes, and that's because Cryptocurrency Jobs is not about me.

Cryptocurrency Jobs is about you, the talented teams building our decentralized future, and the crypto community at large.

But people in the community have encouraged me to share more about my story and how things are going with Cryptocurrency Jobs.

So here goes.

A few years ago, I learned to code.

I started working on Cryptocurrency Jobs in 2017 after I finished the Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies course on Coursera. The idea was to build a job board to help people find opportunities in the crypto space and learn more about the ecosystem.

Over the years, I've featured over 9000 jobs at 1000+ companies and startups, published 385+ issues of the weekly newsletter, and onboarded thousands of talented humans into the crypto ecosystem. All job listings, content, resources, and newsletter are available for free and accessible to all.

Each year, 2 million+ people trust Cryptocurrency Jobs to help them transform their careers. Hundreds of startups trust Cryptocurrency Jobs to help them grow their teams.

Just the thought that if even <1% of those unique humans find an opportunity, the impact & outsized returns we will see in this space is mind-blowing.

And the job board works. It really works and that's because I do things differently than other job boards.

I often get asked how many people are on my team and if Cryptocurrency Jobs is venture-funded.

Cryptocurrency Jobs is independent, bootstrapped, and run by me. I do the code, design, support requests, and everything in between. I’m able to do this because of you. Get in touch, and you’ll always reach me.

Let's grow the crypto ecosystem together, and help usher in the decentralized future by onboarding more humans into this space.

Thank you for considering my grant and for all the support you've given over the years.

Sending you all wagmi vibes,

1492,defi-venture,"A decentralized board game to educate everyone about dApps, Blockchain and DeFi. Inspired by Monopoly but crypto-oriented, with game logic and crypto-economics mechanisms entirely performed by smart contracts running on blockchain.

This project has been initiated during ETHOnline hackathon (October 2020).
https://hack.ethglobal.co/showcase/defipoly-renamed-defi-venture-recsOVnCyl3aHkDvt

Demo

Video

Introduction
As playing is probably the best way to learn new things, the purpose of this game is to allow everyone (especially people NOT familiar with blockchain, dapps and DeFi - we think about most our close friends and family), to play and get fun with these new concepts, in order to get a better understanding of what it is and how decentralized solutions differ from traditional ones, in particular in DeFi.

Remember how the classical Monopoly game let us understanding the basics of money, banks, loans, investments, capitalism.
DeFi-Venture reinvents the Monopoly game, adapting the concepts and mechanism towards those emerging in the blockchain ecosystem.

Game Rules in a nutshell:
As a player, you take the role of a crypto-entrepreneur and your goal is to become the wealthiest player, through founding and developing businesses in the crypto-space. 

All players start with the same amount of cash and from the Genesis block. 
Then, each player takes turn one at a time.

It's your turn: roll the dices, and move on the board. 

When you land on a Startup, you can decide to found it only if no other player did it before. You have to pay the initial capital. Now the startup is yours. 
If you land on a startup that is already owned by another player, you have to buy its product and pay the owner. So, basically, the more startups you own, the more revenues you can expect. 
When you land on a Chance block, you pick a card and you have to perform an action like pay or receive cash. 
When you land on the Covid block: Bad luck! You’re locked down in Quarantine and you can’t play the next round. 

To grow your wealth, you must invest in your startups by injecting more cash, to increase your revenues when other player land on your blocks. 

With the DeFi services, you can earn interest by staking cash, or borrow money by locking your assets as collateral. 

Your investments can also be funded by performing an ICO, that means issuing and selling tokens for your startup. 

Moreover, there is an in-game marketplace to exchange assets between players. 

Why this game
By playing this game, the players learn how to interact with the blockchain. We also hope this will allow mainstream people to realize how some decentralized solutions redefine the way the financial services can be delivered. They would have a better understanding of the DeFi revolution, and eventually it would help them to jump in. 

How It's Made
DeFi-Venture is a fully-decentralized game, meaning that all the game’s mechanisms are performed on the blockchain by a set of smart-contracts.

A GameFactory contract is responsible to create the other contracts required for a game session.
There is an ERC20 smart contract to represent the in-game currency, an NFT contract to manage ownership of startups, a game master contract to implement and check the game rules, and a marketplace contract to manage exchanges.

Because we need very cheap and fast transactions, we are deploying the smart contracts on MATIC blockchain.

We also allow mainstream people (that don't have a crypto-wallet yet) to embark in the game by using PORTIS to quickly get an Ethereum address and connect the Blockchain without having to install Metamask and generate keys.

To go further, we would appreciate the players would not have to pay transaction fees.Using a Gas Station Network would be a satisfying solution.
We would like to explore using Biconomy with Meta-Transactions.",https://levalleux-ludo.github.io/DAPP/DeFiVenture/video.html,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,https://github.com/levalleux-ludo,1

Fast: Since you are querying your local archive node, everything is fast, no network roundtrips are necessary.
Erigon itself is very fast, thanks to the mdbx database, so it is faster than other nodes even locally.
We implemented custom jsonrpc methods inside Erigon's rpcdaemon, so we are able to expose information that the standard jsonrpc API does not expose, but it is available inside the Erigon database.

3386,the-catalandao-building-the-first-digital-nation-,"TL;DR: CatalanDAO is the next step in social coordination, a collaborative effort to launch the world's first Digital Nation DAO, where anybody, Catalan or not, can join as a digital citizen or a supporter.

ℹ️ WHAT IS CATALAN DAO?
We are a decentralized organization (DAO) that is transversal, democratic, acting in a specific geographical area (Catalonia and the Catalan-speaking and cultural countries) but also globally. And, therefore, open to any person or entity that shares these objectives and interests.

WHAT WE WILL DO?
Some potential experiments that we'll bring to vote to the community using token-based voting:
🆔 The first nationwide distribution of tokens using blind-signatures, by airdropping to any person that identifies with a gov-issued Catalan digital certificates.
🌍 Create a digital citizenship scheme for members, with different roles (from citizen to supporter).
🌱 Fund common goods sustainably to impact local and globally.
🖼️ Experiment with NFTs to promote catalan art, language and culture.
🧪 Consider the kinds of economic and governance experiments explored by organizations like RadicalxChange.
🧑‍🎓 Promote the decentralized technologies among the population.
👩‍💻 Organize hackathons to develop Decentralized Governance tools and frameworks.
❤️ Help other digital nation projects in the world to achieve the same goals.

These are just a few of the possible projects we would like to conduct, but with token-based voting and other governance mechanisms, all members will be able to make, develop and vote on proposals.

🐈‍⬛ WHY CATALONIA?
Catalonia is a wonderful place. Catalonia has a history of social self-management that has produced such interesting experiments as an anarchist government during the Spanish Civil War (36-39) and can still be seen in its cooperative and social movement, which today represents 10% of Catalonia's GDP.

The origins of DAOs were also inspired by Catalonia, and a lot of members of the Ethereum community have spent time learning about self-management there.

For this reason, we believe that Catalonia could also be a great place to build the first nation-level DAO, one that goes way beyond a state's borders.

🤝WHO WE ARE?
After one month (The project began in August 2021), we have managed to bring together more than 40 people from different areas such as math, mesh networks, IT, art, social work, marketing, and social economy, among others. For now, we are focused on organizing internally, but soon we will open the project to everyone.

## What is BrightID?

BrightID is building an identity lego that allows users to prove to applications that they only exist once in any given system.

What if you could always prove you were a real unique user?

It’s easy in the real world to ensure you’re dealing with a unique or a specific person, but imagine how many systems could be improved or made possible if every user or account could prove they only exist once as we transition to the digital era?

* Digital voting and governance - including quadratic voting, liquid democracy, and signaling
* Truly universal income or airdrop distributions payable to literally everyone
* Public-goods funding allocation - trust minimized and collusion resistant thanks to MACI
* Social media without millions of bots polluting the discourse
* Credit systems for under-collateralized DeFi
* And so much more...

## How does it work?

BrightID is creating a giant pseudonymous social graph of people all around the world. Users can make private, cryptographically secure connections to people they know, using a smartphone app. This pseudonymous connection data is shared among a decentralized group of computer nodes that store and analyze the public social graph. The nodes of the network determine and verify the likely uniqueness of each account, based on its interconnectivity with other accounts. The user can then use their BrightID verification to prove to any integrated system that they have one and only one account. The potential integrations are endless.

## Where will my contributions go?

BrightID Main DAO is a LAO (a DAO with a legal wrapper) that stewards centralized pieces until they can be decentralized, such as the app registry, website, and app store entries. It also has stewardship over grant and sponsorship income, and functions as a non-profit. It has been committed to BrightID’s core mission and funded the core team since its inception in Feb 2020.

Check our Aragon’s great description of BMAIN and related DAOs.

100% of contributed funds will go to BMAIN DAO.

## What is Bright DAO?

Bright DAO is an effort to pull in many more contributors from the community to grow BrightID at a faster pace. Using the gardens DAO format pioneered by 1Hive, contributors can now create their own proposals and receive their own funding in $BRIGHT community governance tokens.

Art and Supporting in Real Life Environmental Action: Charged Particles Ecology Guild
This section will get the rest of the funding. 
Problems
The world needs more art. Evocative art that changes the way people think about society, the environment and the world around them. With this change, there is a want to make a difference in the world around us and resources need to be channeled to make this change. The two main technologies able to facilitate this change and movement are tokens and NFTs, however there is a disheartening amount of these that are enabling this change.
Tokens and NFTs are valuable when there is a community that believes in them. However for many artists creating new NFTs, as well as attracting and maintaining this community is an issue. In Christchurch, New Zealand there is a community of artists creating a movement in real life through the XCHC. Here many locals and visitors are dissatisfied with the entertainment, nightlife, and creative options in Christchurch and the wider New Zealand. Feeling it lacks the creativity and diversity found in other cities. Without alternatives, the local scene is left with an unhealthy and at times unsafe binge drinking culture, repetitive entertainment, and a socially reserved reputation. Christchurch is known for “closing early”, not because people choose, but because most venues are licensed bars, meaning the night ends when the bar closes. Though the XCHC community has been doing great work with artists in real life for the past seven years, this community remains a bit hidden from the wider world. Unable for people to experience it without physically being at the XCHC. Artists here remain disconnected from the global reach and possibilities enabled by embracing web3 technology, such as NFTs, tokens, and DAOs. However, some are ready to take the next step.
Solutions
To onboard in real life artists into web3 technology, proper onboarding steps need to be carried out as well as incentivizing the artists to take the steps. Charged Particles and Onchain Music are examples of organizations with individuals from them being both influenced by and influencing the XCHC community. Members from all these organizations now realize the need to make full steps into the web3 space but need support in creating onboarding processes. An XCHC community member recently made a purchase of metaverse land that will enable artists to showcase their art in a virtual gallery tied to a physical location (similar to Pokemon Go). This metaverse land, along with other metaverse lands (as acquired), will be used to portray 2d and 3d art, stream music from in real life events, video screenings and more. Bridging the gap from physical art to virtual art. The art portrayed in this metaverse land will be tied to NFTs that artists create from their own wallets after they have been onboarded into the web3 space. In the metaverse not only the art, but the stories of the artists and why they created the art will be portrayed. Especially for events.
An example of such an event is Mary Hush. Mary Hush has created intentional temporary art spaces following a story line for the last several years. Along with that they were one of the first spaces to incorporate gamification, and NFTs into their events. Enabling further art created for these events to become part of the metaverse will build momentum for more of these events to occur and artists to be supported in this movement. Throughout this movement, a percent of the funding would not only support artists but would be channeled towards real life change and organizations that are inspiring it.
There are some examples of tokens channeling funding towards, in real life change 1. Along with that there are organizations, like Giveth, which enable donations towards in real life organizations. Embedding these tokens into NFTs will enable the NFTs to have a liquid market value. Mechanisms to generate yield, such as yield bearing tokens or proper community treasury management can be used to increase the value embedded in these NFTs as well as increase token holders. This will allow the community associated with this to have increased value over time. Charged Particles 1 is an example of a codebase and community that can enable this. For blockchains where Charged Particles doesn’t function, similar functions can be used with NFTs and collective treasury management (Until the Point When CP Is On That Blockchain).
It is expected that this metaverse will create funds that can be used for supporting more artists making the move into the web3 space. Utilizing a decentralized funding model similar to that of Aera Force, where a person refers to someone that should be funded, someone scouts the person to confirm the funding opportunity and the collective agrees if the funding should be distributed, this organization’s aim is to distribute more funding to in real life artists. In return for this funding, the artist would go through the onboarding process and create an NFT of their art (through Onchain Music, Charged Particles, or other technology). A percent of the sale of this NFT then goes towards supporting the organization.
Call Of Action
The next Mary Hush Event is July 23rd. During that event, some of the music created will be streamed to a metaverse area. Along with that, some of the art created during that event will be turned into NFTs and portrayed in the metaverse space. Existing artists that donate art to support this event will rest assured knowing the 100% of the proceeds from that art will go towards IRL environmental action. During the day of the event environmental organizations and web3 regenerative finance organizations will be given the opportunity to speak, as well as present panels. This can be the initial spark for Charged Particles entry into Regenerative Finance, with proceeds from that event going towards tree planting through Grandmother Grove 4. At that time the tree planting organization will be connected with Giveth and GivBacks can be earned supporting this organization into the future.
To carry this out, support is needed from community members to organize the event and create the metaverse. Though volunteer contribution would be much appreciated to do this, it would be great if contributions were able to be rewarded. So in addition to the support could be great to see what resources are out there for metaverse land, rewarding contributors and generally getting the ball rolling.

We have an initiated a decentralized community for dMRV, dMeter. This community is made up of scientific experts, onboarded organizations implementing the regenerative actions, as well as the lay community. 
Satellite surveillance: We introduced Shamba Dynamic (Their Gitcoin) to Astraea and now their orgs are collaborating together. Astraea works with the Nature Conservancy on monitoring their projects around the world, Shamba will help make these tools available to the web3 space. Shamba will lead the incorporation of the open source ecosystem service valuation toolset InVEST, making these tools accessible for the ReFi movement and applicable globally.   
Drone Imagery: For initial 3d modeling of the areas we are covering we are looking to develop a decentralized drone bounty system. One of the organizations that is working on this initially are Village Grid
IOT sensors: We are working with Athena Equity (Their Gitcoin) to deploy environmental sensors that function with FOAM, Helium and other technology infrastructure to gather data from remote areas and make it available online. In particular we are preparing to deploy a case study in Paraguay to gather data wanted by local organizations around wildfire risk in a National Park. 
Georeferenced Imagery: We are in initial conversations with Public Lands Protocol to use some of the tech they developed during a hackathon for rewarding people for the capture of georeferenced imagery data. Along with this we have identified Orgo as having substantial experience in this realm.

1988,louper-tool-for-inspecting-diamond-eip-2535-smart,"The EIP-2535 Diamond standard is a specification for building upgradable smart contracts. Smart contract applications built using EIP-2535 DIamond Standard benefit from greater organization and smaller contract sizes. This is ideal for large complex applications like blockchain games. Aavegotchi and Dark Forest are popular examples of games built using this standard. Unfortunately the standard isn't well supported by popular dev and analysis tools like Etherscan. This makes them harder to inspect and debug.

Louper is a tool for developers and those curious about the composition of smart contracts written using the EIP-2535 Diamond standard. Louper allows users to inspect the components of these contracts as well as interact with them. This greatly improves the developer experience.

Key Features:

View all facets and facet selectors of a Diamond
Interact with (read/write) facets
Add/remove facets from a diamond
View on multiple chains
View contract verification status

543,the-moonmath-manual-to-zk-snarks,"The acronym zk-SNARK stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge,” and refers to where one can prove possession of certain information without revealing the information itself. zk-SNARKs offer a new paradigm for privacy and the potential to securely scale blockchain-based solutions. 

Most explanations struggle to explain how and why they work, so zk-SNARKs remain somewhat “magical” and elusive, deterring developers from exploring or utilizing them in projects. Resources are scattered across blog posts and github libraries. This results in a  high barrier to entry, thereby slowing the widespread adoption of the technology.

We want to change that with our MoonMath Manual to zk-SNARKs, designed for an audience with only minimal experience in cryptography and programming.

We aim to deliver a guide to zk-SNARKS, that begins with a theoretical foundation and builds up to a point where the reader is able to implement complex, real-world zk-building blocks. 

Timeline/Milestones:
First release: Q3 2022
Progress depends on sufficient funding.

that helped the digital work to become a non-fungible and make income from it.

The problem is :
most of the Arabic community still don't know anything about this huge revolution and how to use it and whats the benefit from it.

The solution is :

Iam planing to start an educational videos and courses about #NFT and #Erc20 tokens targeting the Midle East community to tech them how to use and how to create NFT on the blockchain in Arabic language and i believe my courses will help a lot of artists and speculators and collectors to learn how to this technology work and whats the benefit from it,
they will learn how to create NFT and how to buy or sell or trade them.

the funds will be used to promotional the courses to targets more audience and will also will be used to start a new #NFT platform that support Arabic and English language.

When a smart contract is verified in Etherscan it is automatically added to Swarm, a platform designed to provide a sufficiently decentralized and redundant store of Ethereum’s public record. 

This grant will fund the creation and development of a Swarm specific scraper that retrieves the metadata of verified smart contracts published to Swarm by Etherscan. The scraper SHOULD NOT scrape Etherscan website.

Example of a smart contract below:

POA20 verified smart contract in Etherscan: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6758b7d441a9739b98552b373703d8d3d14f9e62#contracts

The scraper should retrieve the hashes (swarm source) for all verified smart contracts . When these hashes are entered through either Etherscan’s Swarm explorer OR the official Swarm hash explorer, they will return the verified smart contract code.

With 10M views across our socials, we've educated millions on Ethereum, DeFi, Web3, Gaming, NFTs & more. We cover all aspects of finance, economics, trading, investing & crypto but our main focus has always been the Ethereum ecosystem. 
Our content spans all formats from written guides to video tutorials. Our monthly Ethereum update episode is the best way to catch up with everything happening of late & covers news, innovation, developments & projects within the Ethereum ecosystem. 

Problem 🔒 
The Ethereum ecosystem moves fast. This is (mostly) a good thing. But for educators like myself, this speed makes it hard to keep my audience up to scratch on the latest from the Ethereum space.

Solution 🔐 
In February, Anthony Sassano and I started a monthly Ethereum update series. (As a video on the Nugget's News YouTube channel and an episode of the Nugget's News Crypto & Finance Podcast.) We have also hired junior researchers to help cover the growing amount of information & news coming out these days.

Why support our regular Ethereum content via Gitcoin Grants? 🤔

1️⃣ Keep the public informed. We all know Ethereum is changing rapidly. So it's crucial that the public are able to access information on Ethereum that’s accurate and up to date. With enough funds I would love to employ more staff.

2️⃣ Help Ethereum reach audiences outside the crypto bubble. Nugget’s News lives and breathes crypto. But we also cover macroeconomics and other asset classes. By showcasing the latest from Ethereum every month, we believe that many who aren’t aware of Ethereum’s potential will seek to learn more.

3️⃣ Save yourself hours of reading. These days, keeping abreast of Ethereum ecosystem developments is a full-time gig. Doing this requires a lot of reading, too. We need more ways to stay up to date on Ethereum.

Recapping Gitcoin Grants Rounds 5–7 🔙

We'd like to thank all who contributed to our grant during the 5th, 6th and 7th rounds of Gitcoin Grants. In particular, thank you to Marketing DAO for selecting Nugget's News as one of the 10 projects to contribute towards in the 5th round.

To develop GY into a strong Social Living media brand which becomes a household name known as a multifunctional platform that satisfies all online requirements of its members whilst assisting in building links around the world.

Buy & Gain concept
Social Living Platform that users can get identity recognition in the blockchain and store their information It is expected once getting the fund required to launch the first blockchain Identity recognition in 6 months then 3 month later the social media should be added to be the gate for the ecommerce and the social living in the blockchain. This can be done with your support and help in funding the business. Please note that part of the project will be open source. The project is going to launch 2 ICOs to support each other so the users will be rewarded in cryptocurrency toward their shopping and for each new born baby staking to be retrave when they reach 18 years old. Users will gain assets toward their activity in the platform. The users should be recognised by the blockchain to be able to spend or use their assets or coins not by their wallets phrase which means no gap for hackers and this is the USP of the GY concept for further development. The platform will facilitate easy access to buy the GY coins for their shopping needs and any other payment requirements where they will gain value from the free coins the users get. This will guarantee the circulation of the GY coins and would raise the price up and give more value to the population to use our platform.

Reach will enable tens of millions of developers to participate in the blockchain community, rather than only the thousands that participate today, by drastically lowering the barrier to entry into blockchain and drastically raising the productivity of DApp developers. A Decentralized Application that used to take months to develop will be able to be completed in weeks.

Updates
""Crypto Startup Reach Raises $12 Million to Build on Ethereum, Algorand"" | Decrypt
""Introducing TEAL Version 3"" | Algorand



The Reach platform provides three services via a domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying DApps and a specialized compiler that projects the specification into the complete application while performing automatic verification of correctness properties.



We allow the developer to write and think at the level of business logic, rather than at the level of the intricate details of a blockchain protocol. Our DSL uses a subset of JavaScript to specify the entire DApp: the smart contract, the clients run on the front-end, the servers run on the back-end, and all communication between each of the pieces. Since the entire specification is in a single language, we enable any developer to quickly create, reason about and deploy DApps.



We represent the DApp with a generalized backend language, and we then use “connectors” to translate this backend language to the correct bytecode, while remaining faithful to the interfaces offered by actual networks. Our backend supports the ability to specify blockchain-specific functionality, where appropriate.



We ensure that the DApp is free from errors without having to write tests of what the program should do. Instead, developers write down what their program must not do, and we ensure that these bad outcomes never occur. The compiler uses type-checking, A Normal-Form transformation, information-flow security, and end-point projection to derive each component correctly from the single specification. The compiler is integrated with a satisfiability-modulo-theories (SMT) theorem prover (e.g. Z3) to automatically check the correctness of the application via developer-specific predicates, as well as automatically generated properties appropriate for all DApps.

2259,idea-factory,"Idea Factory is an open marketplace for Ideas, leveraging UMA and Polygon (Matic), to create a place where users can create, fund, and contribute to ideas in a Sybil resistant way! 

How Idea Factory differs from other ""incubators"":

anyone can create an idea
anyone can fund an idea
By using a governance system, users who contribute to ideas in a meaningful way that also increase the potential worth of that idea can earn a reward
ANY idea, of any kind is welcome and the funding is completely up to user votes to determine which ones should be funded

 Tokens:

Idea Factory uses two tokens: a VOTE token, and an IDEA token. A vote token represents the ""worth"" of Idea Factory itself, by calculating the average amount invested in ideas. The more valuable ideas that are added, the more Idea Factory is accomplishing its goals. An IDEA token, on the other hand, is a unique token created by the founder of an idea who decides the logo, symbol, etc. As more people stake their VOTE token to an idea, the price of that IDEA token will rise.

Potential Problems:

One potential problem with Idea Factory is the potential of people creating ideas that they will never actually complete. The solution that we have came up with, is a liquidity vote. If, at any point, any staker decides that they don't see this idea being complete, actively worked on, or any other reason they can start a liquidity vote. If the majority of stakers vote yes, then the idea token is liquidated with the stakers recuperating (hopefully) the large majority of their stake. 

Another potential problem is one person (or a group of people) spamming worthless ideas, to drive the price of VOTE down. The current working solution for this is to implement a verification system (something Arweave Arverify) to only allow addresses that are determined to be ""authentic"" to create ideas.

This idea is a work in progress. If you have any suggestions, feel free to comment, tweet us on twitter or join our discord at https://discord.gg/rv9sJxSuWs

You can access Query Ethereum directly from the browser, or over https for embedding within software applications.

Potential use-cases:
A standard, simple, flexible API for gathering chain analytics (GraphQL), with no need to run any infrastructure of your own
Gas prices: It may be trivial to pull a good gas price straight off of the blockchain, by running a couple queries with average gas price over a selected window

How it works
Currently the technology is being applied to collectible vinyl toys, but could be applied to other items such as physical art, or fashion with the latter being trialed by Nike. 

A unique serial number is created (In the case of CryptoKaiju this is the locked serial number of the NFC tag) which is applied to the physical item. 
The item is recreated as a non fungible token with the unique serial number used within the Meta information. 
The token is distributed to the person who purchases the physical item.
The physical item is distributed.
When receiving the physical item authenticity can be validated by scanning the NFC chip and checking that the ID matches that of the token.

Diagram of how it works

Why are we fundraising?
Though established in the space with a solution that works, the current iteration of CryptoKaiju is ""clunky"" requiring users to already have an understanding of blockchain technology, a wallet already setup and requires multiple steps to verify the authenticity of a physical object. We would like to use the funds to make the technology ready for mainstream adoption including building apps for validating from a mobile device.

219,blockada-dao,"Blockada DAO is a DAO for funding blockchain meetups around the world. 

Historically, getting any kind of funding in Ethereum required being friends with the ""OG"", the big players in the industry like employees of Consensys or Ethereum Foundation. It's hard to get any kind of support when you're an outsider, and this leads to highly centralized event locations like Berlin, San Fran, Toronto. We believe the event ecosystem needs to decentralize for the benefit of speakers, attendees, and partner spaces who could definitely use some more foot traffic!

This DAO focuses on covering basic expenses so that meetup organizers only have to worry about one thing - attracting good speakers and making sure there's a culture of learning. The less time an organizer needs to spend hounding sponsors for beer and pizza, the more time they can devote to putting a kick ass event together.

At the same time, the DAO has interesting mechanics embedded which let it alter the reputation of partner spaces and event organizers (as well as attendees) by rewarding attendance, good organization, and enthusiastic and supportive event venues.

The funds gathered via this grant, if successful, will be spent on:

Building a simple UI for interacting with the DAO even without a central server. The UI will be locally runnable on anyone's computer without additional hardware or software. It will also be fully open source, of course.

Background

OpenGuitar is a social-educational project to promote computer science learning through an open-source experimental classical guitar, which can be assembled in small workshops. 

Workplan

Our work is organized along two pathways: The builders pathway followed by the players pathway.

The OpenGuitar builders pathway has a focus on STEAM education (science, technology, engineering, arts and math) for children and teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds, including children with disabilities, marginalised children and those living in humanitarian and emergency settings. We are working on “Acustica Lab” - a software based on Max/MSP allowing 2 step ir convolution, filtering, compresion, vst loading, and monophonic audio to midi conversion - all real time. 

About us

We are Fernando Bravo, a cognitive neuroscientist working on music technology and Torsten Goerke, a technologist working on research data infrastructure. We joined forces to empower music educators all over the world by making high quality instruments available to them for teaching music students.

Outlook

Building a cyber-physical commons infrastructure for the OpenGuitar ecosystem is challenging. With Alas DAO we are working to create a Cyber Physical Commons for OpenGuitar. We are a community of researchers and artists who want to reduce the impact of data monopolies in the realm of cyber-physical systems.

Project Q&A

1. What is the defiwrapper?
Defiwrapper is a collection of different DeFi related polywrappers like defi-sdk, coingecko, and many more to be added in future. Since polywrappers are written in webassembly they are cross-platform, sandboxed, composable and yet light-weight than traditional JS SDKs. 

2. What is defi-sdk?
defi-sdk is one of the polywrapper offered by defiwrapper. It's a cross-chain defi aggregator sdk. 

3. Why yet another defi-sdk?
The reason for building yet another SDK is the problems with current SDKs:

 Some SDK uses smart-contracts for aggregating the data from various protocol but this isn’t very scalable and efficient
 Some SDK uses centralised server for this and gated with Oauth and what not.
 Only EVM compatible, doesn't support other popular L1 like Solana, Cardano, 

We are creating a decentralized, scalable and trully cross-chain SDK.

4. What's the advantage of coingecko polywrapper over calling coingecko API directly?
Coingecko polywrapper has concrete schema for input, output and all the methods which makes it easy to develop with it. 
It will do input validation and parse output in the correct schema format so that client of coingecko polywrapper don't need to do it manually. 
It can securely run on any WASM runtime. Ex: You can run it inside Gelato resolver.
It is easily composable with other polywrappers.

This would be powerful, as proper facilitation and expansion of crypto - as well as blockchain infrastructure - would be a massive leapfrog opportunity for the region, and has the potential to reverse the Caribbean's downward economic spiral (there has been little significant growth in the Caribbean since the global financial crisis, and multiple natural disasters + covid has made things drastically worse).

In addition to building clubs and introducing blockchain curricula to universities, we would also onboard students toward projects such as Cryptozombies.io and Rabbithole.gg, as well as role-focused DAOs such as ScribeDAO and DeveloperDAO, so that they can get robust, hands-on experience in an extra-curricular environment, creating true crypto-natives (and ensuring that the universities themselves don't become gatekeepers for crypto content). 

Short term internal goals:
Hire a core team (2-3 individuals to assist with operations)
Finalize structure and incentives for Education and Public Policy Committees
Redesign website to include educational resources and a data/research repository, as well as an interactive registry of community members 

Medium to long term internal goals:
Scale-up campaign for outreach to Caribbean students to bring them into the various educational programs
Build out membership model
Begin process to progressively decentralize


June Update:
Plans are being finalized and the marketing campaign is beginning for our 'Intro to Web3' summer workshop series, end of July (open, free, Caribbean-wide)
Planning out governance structure/contributor incentives - push to decentralize begins soon after workshop series",http://cbahub.org,393,403,248,2,6,https://github.com/stefdelev,1

The next stage is to move on to build the exchange and I am proposing a DAO to carry this out though I am currently coding this on my own time. Most likely KaliDAO as it is easy and I proposed that 5% of the funds in the treasury to go to an IP cause or charity each year. The rest of the funds will go to operations and maintenance and balance be paid out in dividends or reinvest for those wanting to receive more tokens in lieu. 

Before this for those who may be interested, I have prepared what I called a DECK for another who wish to know more to support this project. https://nftpatent.net/Nftpatent(2022March).pdf

Introduction 

yOur Golden Dream is a collective’s vision for the S33D ecosystem, initially describing a vision to grow “a distributed seed & story library, while recalibrating the value of seed saving and storytelling”. 

The intention has always been to evolve the medium we shared yOur Golden Dream through. Originally printed and signed by hand on hemp paper, we envisioned a process of metamorphosis, utilising simple cryptographic tools to ratify proposals and amendments as we evolved the dream. 

Adhering to CoGov’s methodology for ‘vulnerably transparency’ Protocol.love,  we formalized The S33D Collective with the drafting and invocation of ‘S33D Collective Formilsation Charter’ This enabled us to begin transcribing our process of co-weaving openly. 


“If you read onwards you become part of this tale” Terence McKenna


This Grant

We are currently completing Version 3.0 of ‘yOur Golden Dream’. Including embedding the ‘S33D Collective Formilsation Charter’ and the S33D.Life-Iki (an ecosystem map) as an open-source repository. 

Having authored ‘yOur Golden Dream’, we continue to breathe life into this living charter, the clear and visible spine of our collective’s emerging governance lattice. This grant is therefore to assist in evolving ‘yOur Golden Dream’ blooming into a shared reality. Our mission now includes:


NARRATING the Dream of weaving together a distributed seed and story library. 
STEWARDING the Methodology by which people can suggest changes and additions to ‘yOur Golden Dream’, and the collective’s assets. 
EXPLORING and Prioritising the most sustainable and unique ways to print, present, and sign ‘yOur Golden Dream’, using both ancient crafts and modern technology. 
SHARING these Open technological templates, across a diversity of mediums. 
CURATING & CREATING the Tools and Stories for the dream to bloom. 


S33D Milestone and Accomplishments 

Our dream to build a distributed seed & story library is taking shape. If you are new to S33D please see ‘More on S33D’ below to join the journey and discover how yOur vision is manifesting. 


S33D Dream Printing

We printed the first public version of ‘yOur Golden Dream’ first titled ‘The Golden Charter’, Q2 2018, and hashed it onto the Bitcoin Blockchain on 5th November 2018, we updated it with a second version 6th November 2019. then the ‘S33D Dream’
This Year we began the grant drafting process while revising and hashed the document on the 7th of each month (see Revisions Index), until we formalised the collective with ‘S33D Collective Formilsation Charter’ and agreed to progress to compiling Version 3 early with the minimum addition of this charter.

More on S33D 

S33D is a marriage between the ancient and modern worlds. A collective weaving the vision for a distributing seed & story library, across a network of community pods and plant hives. We initiate the recalibration of our individual and collective sovereign value systems by matching local & global seed saving communities, whilst providing spaces for heart-centered exchanges of; stories, traditional crafts, and organic seed and produce provenance trails.  

Join us in co-coding the DNA of this living and breathing ‘Ancient sm(art) canvas’, assist the birth with cryptographic precision by…

Mapping 
By hashing and storing seed flows, tree distribution, and harvest cycles across distributed ledgers. 
Offering wider and more transparent access to a diversity of food, medicines, plant-based products, as well as their orbiting data.We seek to map every element of our supply chain, and the systems that service it. 

Feeding
Freedom with Creative consumption.
By revaluing the role biodiversity has to play within both our local and global value flows, S33D begins to unlock the full potential of organic assets whilst protecting the seeds of sovereignty. 
Focusing innovation around local, open-source libraries and gardens, S33D opens up a playground of edible education. Empowering us to see the creation inherent in our consumption, we remember we can feed the future world we wish to live in, while feeding ourselves. 

Securing
Data sovereignty for nature and knowledge. 
The SLN (S33D’s Library Network) is harnessing a growing suit of tools to assist us in reconnecting with our sovereign origins through education, trade, and localised community curation.

“Diversity goes hand in with decentralisation, and the creation of decentralised, biodiverse food systems is the key to the design of a world without hunger. For this, a shift from globalisation to localisation is vital. Globalisation has reduced food to a commodity while expanding the control of agribusiness. Localisation reclaims food as nourishment, expands community control of food systems, and promotes food democracy and food sovereignty.” Vandana Shiva

2180,hedgehog-hedge-downside-risk-for-your-crypto-posi,"Hi all,

The current DeFi ecosystem is awesome with decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, borrow markets and more! However many of these applications use more centralized components with their own consensus algorithm like oracles, token voting or contract ownership. It is understandable and the applications are awesome, but more research and development towards decentralized applications that only rely on the security of Ethereum is needed, no tradeoffs. Bonding curves together with a programmable blockchain allows for decentralized applications without a need for a separate more centralized consensus algorithm.  

Hedgehog is a protocol that offers different decentralized options to allows anyone to hedge their positions, using bonding curves to remove the need for a separate consensus algorithm. The current design of hedgehogs implements two components:
Shorting market based on a quadratic bonding curve. Hedgehog Short allows anyone to create a single sided market (one token per market) for any ERC20 token. The single sided market can be used as a prediction market for depreciation of a token simply by deposit (minting a hedge token) and withdraw (burning the hedge token). When users deposit because of predicted depreciation the token price of the minted hedge token will increase based on the bonding curve. If users withdraw because of expected appreciation the token price will decrease. This hedges the price movement of the underlying asset like WETH. The benefit of this design is that the hedging market results in tokens that are stabilized for changes in demand of the underlying asset. A basket of different assets could be used to create a new stabilized asset class. Hedgehogs concept is live at app.hedgehog.financial. For more details please refer to the white paper or the docs.
Put option market based on a virtual bonding curve between two ERC20 tokens. Hedgehog Put allows anyone to create a put option market for any ERC20 token. Once the market is created anyone can provide liquidity with their personal price range for the options they want to sell. Once liquidity is provided anyone can buy put options that are available based on the virtual bonding curve, for a fixed future price within a max timeframe (for example two weeks). The buyer of the put potion pays a fee for the put option that is distributed among the liquidity providers with that range. If the price between two ERC20 tokens is below the put option price the user can exercise their option and sell at the put option price. Hedgehog put is currently in active development.

The potential grants will be used for the audit of the total hedgehog protocol and the final implementation of Hedgehog Put. If you have questions or would like to contribute do not hesitate to contact me.

Your donations will help us  reach millions with top-tier content and collaborations, excite the public, and drive attention to crowdfunding and crowdsourcing projects of maximal impact. 

New For Gitcoin Round 14!
Thanks to your contributions in GR13 we've been able to start producing longevity focused Life Noggin videos already! Now we are planning a ~12-part video series collaboration with a group of top-tier YouTube celebrities designed to engage the public on the intersection of healthy human longevity and other issues of the day that people are already impassioned about - including blockchain technology. Help us reach $25,000 in GR14 to allow us to begin immediately!

Here's a few examples of the kinds of videos we can produce a ton of with your support! 



   
About Life Noggin

Life Noggin is one of the largest science education channels on YouTube, and has been consistently informing and engaging the public for almost a decade. Now that it’s become part of the team at Lifespan.io, excellent quality videos on all aspects of the critically important topic of healthy human life extension can be made to reach millions. Life Noggin also has the connections and ability to collaborate with the largest creators on YouTube, opening up exciting avenues to reach an ever-expanding audience, and engage them in this most important field of work. 

How Your Funds Will Make a Massive Difference

To reach the largest audience possible on platforms such as YouTube it is vitally important to release high-quality content frequently - ideally at least once a week - as this greatly prioritizes the channel’s content in relevant algorithms. Your support will allow us to bring on additional script-writers, editors, and animators, so that we can greatly increase our rate of video production. This will create a virtuous circle: more videos and thus more opportunities to educate and excite the public regarding healthy human life extension, and also the reach of each one of these videos being magnified by the collective algorithmic benefits of a high-functioning and popular channel.

In sum this means that your support can have an incredible magnifying effect in terms of people reached, and consequent downstream effects of more scientists, fundraisers, investors, and advocates joining in the work of extending healthy human lifespan.

The Life Noggin art style could also be perfect for creating relevant NFT series in support of life extension research, and increased support would allow us to explore such possibilities sooner rather than later.

We build kinship with one another:
We draw from political lessons, grow in our leadership, and expanding our base to build a stronger movement.

2103,open-source-climate-offsets-network,"Open source developers -- make a difference on climate change!  Join us to build an MVP to fund renewables in emerging markets and scale carbon offsets through a DAO.

If we're going to do something about climate change, two things must happen this decade:
Fund $23 trillion of climate-smart investments in emerging markets
Scale up carbon offsets by a factor of 20x to 100x in one decade

Yet both of these goals are stalled by inefficient institutions and outdated processes.

As open source developers, we don't have to stand by and watch.  We can make both happen--with code and community.  We've been working on an open source Operating System for Climate Action as part of the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger project.  Using Hyperledger and Ethereum blockchains, we're building a combination of 3 tools that could drive climate action using distributed ledgers:
 A trusted data ledger, built on Hyperledger Fabric, which turns data such as energy usage into audited emissions.
An ethereum emissions tokens network that could transact emissions and offsets.
A DAO to let the people on the network collectively take climate action instead of waiting for centralized institutions like governments and utilities.

We've already completed proof of concept development of all 3 components, and they're all available as open source on github.

The next step is to create an elegantly simple yet powerful Minimum Viable Proof of Concept using these components that could solve some major problems in climate change:
Funnel capital to clean development projects, such as renewable energy, especially in developing economies.
Validate claims from projects about the amount of carbon emissions they're offsetting based on real data from utility bills and solar inverters.

In this MVP, users in the US or Europe could sign up and integrate their utility bills into the Hyperledger Fabric data blockchain to calculate the carbon emissions from their utility bills.  Simultaneously, these users or their sponsors would commit to offsetting their emissions by staking tokens to purchasing emissions offsets on the ethereum emissions tokens network.

Meanwhile, renewable energy project developers in developing economies could use the same Hyperledger Fabric data blockchain to calculate the amount of avoided carbon emissions from their wind and solar projects.  The emissions offsets buyers would then use the DAO to vote on whether to accept the emissions reductions as valid carbon offsets.  Once accepted, the offsets are issued as tokens on the ethereum emissions tokens network and can be traded and retired to offset the emissions of the users.

As a sponsor of this grant, you could help with the development of the project and the funding of emissions offsets of the intial MVP.  You will be given priority access to beta test the system and voting tokens in the DAO.

Winners of Cosmos Cross-Chain Hackaton in 3rd place
https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-the-cross-chain-hackathon-winners-698b6d03bd6

Motivation
We believe this technology should be open for all, and we could have a huge community to bring new ideas and create a cooperative system.

We want to build an IoT Blockchain, to keep track of variables in a secure and distributed way, and to make this network accesible for all. We plan to release an Open Hardware, so everyone can manufacture and assembly his own hardware, and an open SDK, to create new and exciting ideas based on our business model.

Conditions
All of this will be free to use, modify and sell. All the DataNodes connected to the network would be able to persist information, change DataNode configuration remotely, activate outputs, access the historic data and receive alerts based on pre configures parameters. There will be no fix charges for DataNodes, only transaction fees that will be kept to a minimum to sustain validators and holders.

Token Economics
DataNodes persistin data, developers incoporating new tools, manufacturesrs creating new hardware and companies selling the products, will generate a flow in the network, that will allow to new third party services to be offered, such as,

Possible new Markets
Electronics Manufacturer could provide custom made DataNodes based on the OpenSDK and OpenHardware we will provide
Local Developers could use platforms such as Arduino to create custom applications using our OpenSDK
Local Distributors/Integrators could buy DataNodes ready to use and sell a service for final customer as an aggregated of the service they provide
DataNodes will use probes for measuring phisycal variables, those probes will require calibration and certificates for calibration in order for data to be accurate. Calibration Laboratories could sell their services and charge the user a fee for loading the calibration certificate to the blockchain.
Developers can create Dapps for calibrators to load the certificates and promote their services, a trusted rank can be created on the Blockchain for calibrators based on customer and Authorities ranks.
Besides of the automated alert system, some users would prefer to delegate the variables monitoring, business specialized in monitoring could take care of receiving those alerts and setup more complex alerts and take care of the actions based on the alerts and charge the user for that service. Data would be accessible once the owner delegate that service.
Developers can create intelligent Daps that create sophisticated reports for the customers, and customers could pay subscriptions for using this apps of but a report using Qon economy model.
Developers could sell advanced detection algorithms to create more sophisticated alert systems based on the Blockchain model and charge for using or buying those algorithms.
DataNodes OpenSDK will include the libraries to read measures of some common probes and to be ready for a bunch of industries. Developers could create custom implementations for other businesses and industries and sell their devices or firmware.
Central authorities like the government could benefit for having fast and trusted data access and developers could provide some useful tools to deliver reports in a standardized format for those agencies.
Quality assurance algorithms and Dapps could be created that based on information reported by the DataNode will analyse and add some kind of certificate label to the product.

😃  In short - we’re building the safest game-changing secure platform and we need some help. Jump right into this description and we’ll tell you details!
Our story

We’ve been working on making DeFi safe and successful since the very beginning of DeFi.

The DEFIYIELD team released several products for investing in DeFi that includes:
👾 Investing Dashboard
🦾  the Game-Changing rapid audit Scanner 
🦿  the Risky Contract Manager tool 
🤖  the Largest Audit Database, 
👽 the Rekt Database, 
👨‍💻  the Impermanent Loss Calculator. More to come!

Read details about each product →

🪙  COMING SOON: Announced in June 2021 the $DEFI token has introduced a community-driven governance token. Details coming soon. 

👨‍🌾  Right now the DEFIYIELD community is one of the biggest communities in the Yield Farming industry and actively participates in the DEFIYIELD development process.

Take a peek inside the DEFIYIELD product

Management toolkit

We developed the management toolkit for safe and accessible DeFi. The only security dashboard on the market combining features for effective crypto asset  management and a built in safety infrastructure allowing users to be aware of risks and handle them;
Ttrack your PROFIT and LOSS, see the transaction history, pools you’ve staked your funds in, NFTs, deposits and more.
The dashboard is designed to be compatible with Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum,  Avalanche, Solana, Polkadot and all non-EVM-compatible chains.  

Audit Database
We develop the world’s only audit database that includes all the audits for DeFi projects collected with love. The archive contains 1800+ audits and is being updated everyday. 
Check →

REKT Database 
Our Rekt database helps advanced users get familiar with how scams work and what are the patterns to avoid. 
Check →

These 2 archives along with our internal large Smart Contract Weaknesses Database are fundamentals to develop 2 essential tools:

Game Changer Smart Contract Vulnerability Scanner
 Free express audit tool that combines all the tools above and generates an automated audit report in several minutes with the explanation, issues location and recommendation on how to fix it.
By the moment, the scanner processed more than 15 thousand smart contracts, having revealed over 900K vulnerabilities of different severity levels and over 2K scams.


Approvals Analyzer 
 Analyze token allowances, count the total risk exposure amount of funds and revoke allowances for untrustworthy projects.
Check →


API
We encourage developers to join us and use our APIs. We provide public APIs of Audit and REKT Database.
You can check all of those on our Github page →
We share an open access safety toolkit and databases including DeFiYield’s smart contract scanner, the SCW registry, the security audit database, the rekt database and the advanced impermanent loss calculator.

Independent Audits 

Since the very beginning of DeFi in July 2020 we have performed 50+ independent audits. 
We pioneered the concept of independent audit by offering to our community a possibility to choose projects that we should audit.  It’s one of the unique solutions we provide.

Educational Content
On our Youtube channel and Medium blog, we're regularly posting educational content - we invite founders of key DeFi projects for interviews, publish Ultimate Guides for Yield Farming on different chains, and discuss the hottest topics of DeFi.

DEFIYIELD’s values are Safety, Simplicity, Security. And we need your help protecting these!

How to support us? 
We appreciate any form of community support. 
You can:

Our plans for utilizing funds
We’re completely self-funding and we’re actually on early days of the DEFIYIELD DAO establishment.
We have a lot of cool features and new ideas we want to implement. Thus we do need to pay devs and pay for the maintenance of our databases and API.
We are pioneers of free independent DeFi audits and  we put our entire experience to maintain the unique Audit&REKT databases, Vulnerability Scanner and all our tools. Our products are public goods - we provide access to Databases for free as well as to APIs because we value DeFi accessibility.

Our Roadmap
Advanced Automatic Smart Contract Audit Scanner - by uniting 3 databases we are building the most professional way to get the audit report automatically in 1 minute.
Advanced APY explorer - using our 1-year long experience of everyday collecting projects for dailyAPY infographics we surely can provide the best UX.
Management toolkit development - We want to hire more devs for the process to be faster and to fund the further cooperations with leading projects of DeFi.
SAFETY SHIELD AT THE HEART OF THE DASHBOARD
 Our Approved Contracts tool and Vulnerability Scanner have grown enough  to become a 24-hour advisor in your phone by sending you notifications straightaway after detecting a vulnerability in your approved smart contracts.

Of course, involvement and participation of our community along with all the DeFi users is vital in the process of the Safety Shield development. For us, any form of your contribution matters - donating to the project, using our API, joining the chat, supporting us by advice and meaningful feedback and many more.

3753,yubiai-marketplace-funding,"Proof Of Humanity is currently one of the hottest projects in the crypto community. It has vast potential to add value to the people and the community as a whole. Hence, many projects are starting to emerge, to help contribute to their mission. And Yubiai is one of them.

Yubiai is a marketplace for humans that had been verified. With an address in Proof Of Humanity, a person is able to buy and sell goods, services, NFTs, educational courses, and much more; using their Cryptos. For each transaction, there will be a fee intended to burn UBIs and help fund the project, while still accomplishing our main purpose.

Some of the costs that require funding are: 

- Monthly Fleek.co and annual custom domain (DNS).
- Covering expenses for collaborators and founders.


How did we come up with MarketPlace?

Ever since the origins of mankind, the first means of ‘payment’ has been bartering, which dates back to the Neolithic period. Bartering was based on the consensus between two or more parties, and its execution resulted in added value for the goods being transacted. Cows, salt, pepper, and feathers were some of the currency used for these exchanges. As centuries went by, different types of currency started to appear, leading the way to the fiat currency as we now of today. Fiat currency is used nowadays in MarketPlaces such as Amazon, MercadoLibre, Alibaba, etc., providing value to these payment methods.

How will it function?

Every Human registered on  ProofOfHumanity will have access to the store with their address. Users will be able to buy and sell services using stable coins(DAI) and other ERC20 tokens.  In the future, we plan on making each user account's as NFTs soulbounded(SBTs) so they can be upgraded as they use it.

4126,verse-gallery-the-first-physical-nft-gallery-in-s,"The first permanent physical NFT gallery in Scandinavia: 'verse gallery

There are few limits in the crypto world, and 'verse gallery is exited to redefine how art galleries operate and exhibit their work.

'verse is more than a gallery. We are a much needed emerging learning center that works as the only physical space for the public to visit in order to have their questions and concerns answered when it comes to blockchain, crypto, and NFTs. By creating a physical room for discussions, information, and innovation to flourish, we will be able to make crypto and blockchain less abstract as we present the technology through well-known means and traditions.

Our vision is to manifest ourselves as the main center to educate, transform, and empower the public about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. We wish to impact Scandinavia through art, and will therefore exhibit digital art pieces on our walls as we believe it is a great way to introduce the average person on the street to the opportunities that come within the crypto space, and we believe our gallery will in the longterm benefit the whole crypto community by informing a broader aspect of the society about the different utilities of blockchain technology. We aim to reach every segment of the population, and the attendees in our gallery opening belonged to every demographic group of the Norwegian society - including Erna Solberg, Norway's former Prime Minister (2013-2021). 

As for now we are functioning as an information center for the curious guests that visit us. Many of them open their first digital wallet during their in our gallery and ask questions about short term and long term investments and general guidance.

In order to fund the gallery's idealist mission, we allow different events to take place here after our opening hours and sell educational books.

We are strategically located in a busy area close to Oslo National Academy of the Arts and Oslo Metropolitan University - the future creators and users of Web 3.0. With 'verse gallery, we are creating the first permanent space for blockchain tech to flourish in Scandinavia as an innovation hub for crypto, NFTs, and DAOs. 

'verse gallery exist to give recognition to the artists and creators that work with digital art but have no physical space to exhibit their work. NFTs are mostly traded in private and almost only exhibited through computer and telephone screens - we are convinced that it is due time to give recognition to artists that use blockchain technology to authenticate their artwork by providing them a physical space to be exhibited, like traditional galleries would. We also seek to make the NFT and crypto space more inclusive though our female artist network and through our focus on minority created artwork curated regardless of people's socioeconomic backgrounds. 

We are looking for funding to finance rehabilitation of the existing office space in order to create an open office room with eight computers that will be accessible for those interested. These computers will have the necessary softwares installed in order to create digital art and be creative in a social environment. We are aware that many software programs and hardware tools can be expensive and take much storage on private computers and laptops. In order to include everyone and make the crypto space even more inclusive, we want to ensure that those with less resources have a place to be creative. 

We are here to stay as the property of 'verse gallery is privately owned, until it is one day owned by all partakers through a DAO. To start off this project is more centralized that what we would like, as we are getting more established and gaining global popularity we would like to launch a verseDAO that is much more decentralized and autonomous where our community members can make decisions about what we curate and where in the physical world we should open up the next 'verse gallery for educational purposes (Lisbon, London, Boston being top contenders for now).

There are a lot of people in the Arab world living who know nothing about this technology especially in developing countries, this website is for them to learn about the Blockchain technology and how to use it and to know about the cryptocurrencies
As we know that many sites are only in the English language, but knowledge must be available in several languages, so that everyone is equal.

A whole section is dedicated to teaching beginners to increase knowledge about the Blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

We chose the site name: Cryptoin(bl)Arabic so that everyone can access and search for it easily.

All educational articles and news are completely free for everyone.

But the obstacle remains in the development of the website and the translators' expenses, basic expenses so that we can continue the project that we started.

777,darwin-marx-revolution-theory-of-evolution-greate,"ABOUT THE BOOK

Despite all the biased and unfounded critique that Historical Materialism has received from all ideological directions over the years, it remains nevertheless a solid scientific theory that enables us to understand the overall ebb and flow of developments in society from the distant past to our present time.

Man has slowly over the years, for better or for worse, drifted towards a contentious manners of sustaining life and creating a global livelihood through neoliberal capitalistic methods. The intention of the author is to expose the erroneous justifications continually made between the theoretical basis of Darwin and Marx by unifying the predictive ability of a coherent R/evolutionary phenomenological theory.

For most political scientists, “evolution” is simply meant to infer some basic type of the historical path in which events are connected to each other over time. The majority of political scientists, however, have not attempted to take evolution seriously in their own understandings of politics. 

In statistics, the phrase ""correlation does not imply causation"" refers to the inability to legitimately deduce a cause-and-effect relationship between two variables solely on the basis of an observed association or correlation between them. The scientific method enables these topics of this research to be methodologically carried out with the implementation of among other tools of inquiry; Evolutionary Game Theory, Public Choice Theory, Cladistics and Zoology among others.

The book presents a theoretical framework wherein the full scope of social contracts is dismantled through a thorough examination of the fallacy of principal-agent problem. The author exclaims; ""correlation implies causation""! Hence, by removing the logical fallacy in the comparison of the crumbling foundations of the ongoing war between philosophical idealism and realism, a realistic outlook for the future of Marxist theory becomes intertwined to the genetical legacy of mankind’s purpose as the anthropocentric crown jewel of the animal kingdom.

Herein a directional view of evolutionary theory is developed for one of the main political paradigms of the modern era, in which two events occurring together are taken to have established a cause-and-effect relationship. This fallacy is also known by the Latin phrase ""cum hoc ergo propter hoc"" (""with this, therefore because of this""). 

The predictive allowance of this commutative epistemological interchange seeks to manifest the emergent ""R/evolution"" of Social exchange theory and the destiny of humanity in the Taxonomic rank.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Ciprian Pater is an avid student of political science and social studies, he emphasises the scientific method, epistemological foundations and inquiry into ""philosophy of mind"" as being fundamental to his inquiry into a metaphysical and transcendental universal theory of everything.

2918,molochv3-codename-baal,"Moloch V3 (codename Baal) is a huge step forward in DAO governance. Building on our experience with and the success of V2, Moloch V3 introduces a suite of significant improvements that expand the design space for DAO governance.

After careful design, implementation, and numerous optimizations, the Moloch V3 contracts are complete!

We are eager for communities and developers to start using and building for Moloch V3 DAOs, but first it needs an audit. And audits are expensive! That's where this grant comes in: all contributions to this grant will go towards funding an audit.

Moloch V3 (Baal) Features

Massively upgraded shares and loot functionality
Both shares (economic exit rights and voting rights) and loot (economic exit rights only) are now ERC20 tokens
This creates full composability and compatibility with ERC20-based apps and protocols (eg, token-gating, etc)
The DAO can toggle on or off transferability for shares and loot independently (off = permissioned DAO a la Moloch V2)
Full support for vote delegation a la Compound Governor
Full support for vote with signature a la Compound Governor

Shamans and extensibility
Shamans are external contracts that the DAO can approve for special permissions
Manager shamans can mint/burn shares and loot without a DAO proposal -- this enables a brand new design space for DAO formation and governance (trustless flash DAOs, share staking, and much more)
Governor shamans can adjust governance parameters with out a DAO proposal (see below)
Admin Shamans can toggle share/loot transferability without a DAO proposal

Adjustable governance parameters
All governance parameters are now adjustable by the DAO (via proposal)
Also adjustable by a governor shaman, if established by the DAO

More flexible proposals
Moloch V3 proposals have arbitrary execution, which means they can interact with any smart contract
This means that DAOs no longer have to move funds into a Minion (breaking ragequit) in order to take, say, DeFi actions
Proposals are multi-send compatible, which means multiple actions can be stacked together into a single proposal

Gnosis Safe as treasury
Using the Zodiac pattern, a Moloch V3 DAO can use a Gnosis Safe as its treasury
Supports all on-chain assets, including ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, veTokens, native coins, etc
Enables compatibility with all of the Safe-based apps and tools
Facilitates easy ""upgrade"" from a multisig to a DAO
Migrate to another DAO framework without moving funds

Advanced ragequit
Share- and loot-holders can now choose which tokens they want to receive when ragequitting
Removes the need for the DAO to approve (née ""whitelist"") tokens before receiving/spending them

Potential Additional Features
Add an option for a proposal sponsor to vote yes along with their sponsorship
DAO can use an external contract as its ragequittable treasury

427,deep-work-staking-hackathon,"Join us for the worlds first distributed, structured and outcome focused Hackathon, in which we will create a novel staking product from scratch.


Better designed interfaces for the future of DeFi

The Problem
Blockchain interfaces lack good experience design, especially when it comes to interacting with money and smart contracts.
More and more products will require well designed interfaces to increase liquidity of their products and reduce risk, yet most cannot afford to experiment.

Opportunity
Staking is an online behaviour that has never existed before and we want to run a Hackathon to design novel interfaces that make staking easy to use.
As part of an open source design movement, we want to share the results with the industry and get experience designing products for the future along the way.

For Designers
Design an interface at the cutting edge of technology and user interaction.

For Projects
Rapidly open-source the best UX solutions for staking.


Design fast, together

The Hackathon will consist of a guided Deep Work Sprint, which is a remote collaborative process to align on a goal, come up with solutions and combine the best ideas in 3 workshop sessions.

You don't need to know or prepare anything before we start and you will finish with a clickable MVP prototype.


How is this Hackathon different?

We offer a creative structure and expert guidance throughout the Sprint.
We will guide you through the first 3 days and constantly give support throughout the process, until each team has finished their prototype.

Each team will end up with a unique prototype, guaranteed!
It doesn't matter your skillset, this hackathon focuses on having a creative user facing outcome.

No coding skills required
Because we mainly focus on the creative part, no coding skills are necessary to participate in the hackathon.

All funding goes to organisation and prizes
Everyone gets a prize, and the rest of the funding will be used to pay for software licences and accounts.

You will learn the most productive creative process in the world
Design Sprints are already conquering the world by helping teams collaborate with unprecedented efficiency. With Deep Work Sprints we teach you a structure you can use within your team after the hackathon, to create unique prototypes in a matter of days.


About Deep Work
Over the last year, we have worked on and designed over 15 blockchain products, completely distributed.
Our process, which is based on the GV Design Sprint, is a workshop consisting of three four hour sessions with additional asynchronous 3 days of prototype design and user testing.
We have worked on many staking products for teams like ConsenSys CodeFi, Nexus Mutual, Hummingbot, ETH Foundation and are happy to share our learnings.

»TRY THE DEMO ON GOERLI TESTNET«

ETHTurin followed the 2020 hackathon with a monthly Focus Meetup of local devs throughout 2020 and 2021. Our goal: research, design and implement a first on-chain Copyright Management system for music, where owning copyright licenses is not a matter of legal enforcement, but rather pivots around incentives.

Major CMOs around the world (Copyright Management Organizations: ASCAP, PRS, GEMA, SIAE, SACEM etc) have a common registry for authors, but not for songs. We tackled that opportunity during our ETHTurin 2020/2021 Meetup by providing a PoC of a public protocol for everyone to rely on, built on top of Ethereum.

Our assumption is that ""If Alice plays a lot of Queen songs in her bar, she is boosting Queen music in social environments, therefore she should receive reputation/governance tokens connected to Queen"".

On past 19-20th of June 2021 we launched HackDeLaMusique, a focus hackathon run in Turin with live music contributions from around the globe. By the end of the two days, we had a functional Demo DApp ready.

STRUCTURE

Deposit Copyright (Multisig/IPFS/Registry contract):
Content uploader on IPFS, returns CID
Create Multisig between authors, define shares
All authors check content, shares and sign-in to the Multisig
Once signed, any address can confirm the deposit (Multisig + CID) to the Registry Contract

Pay Copyright (TipJar contract):
Select the CID on IPFS you have to pay for
Select the one licence available (TipJar contract will allow different ERC1155 token IDs to be receipted for payments. E.g. you pay 10, you get ID A token. You pay 20, you get ID B token. By now we hard-coded to one option)
Receive your ERC1155

_____________

HOW TO ONBOARD TRADITIONAL CMOs

In order to give this project a chance of real impact, it is fundamental that we achieve the following:
the on-chain CMO should tend to a protocol-only nature or no profit institution managed by ERC1155 token holders. Any other form might give rise to power struggles between the many traditional CMOs.

3126,blocklatina,"Hello everybody! My name is Jorgelina and I am an educational content creator on cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance.

The reason for this Grant: When I began to study blockchain technology and decentralization, it was very difficult for me to find content in Spanish that was free,of quality,clear,and tools that were within my reach, etc.,that is why I have created this easy and friendly content,to help those who are just beginning them to who are just beginning and are still training. 

I am from Argentina, a country where inflation has devoured the income of its inhabitants for decades, and does not have a high degree of financial deepening, so not everyone has the tools to fend for themselves or know how to do it.

I understand that there is a technological revolution from DeFi that is here to stay and education is a fundamental piece for early adoption.

That is why, a year and a half ago I created Blocklatina, a place where I can pour out my passion for teaching, to put in simple language what this fascinating world of cryptocurrencies is about.

I do not give investment recommendations or financial advice. At Blocklatina you will find quality tools and content about blockchain technology and decentralized finance, with simple tutorials, step-by-step explanations, interviews with prominent people in the community and current issues.

And the best thing is that everything that is offered is free!

We are already more than 10 thousand people on Instagram!

I am very happy with what has been achieved so far, but I would like to continue growing

I tell you my proposal and what I would use the grants for.

I will use the proceeds to improve the visual quality of Blockatina, adding a web page, better editing tools, etc.
I will buy tools that will be raffled among the community, such as: hardware wallets, paid courses on advanced programming, and other articles that are proposed in the community (I am open to ideas and suggestions)

Hola a todos! Mi nombre es Jorgelina y soy creadora de contenido educativo sobre criptomonedas y finanzas descentralizadas. 

La razón de este Grant: Cuando comencé a estudiar la tecnología blockchain y la descentralización me fue muy difícil encontrar contenido en español que sea gratis y de calidad, que sea claro, herramientas que estuvieran a mi alcance, etc, y por eso deseo que los que recién comienzan a capacitarse encuentren un camino mucho más amigable. 

Soy de Argentina, un país donde la inflación devora el ingreso de sus habitantes hace décadas, y no hay un alto grado de profundización financiera, por lo cual no todos tienen herramientas para cubrirse ni saben cómo hacerlo.

Entiendo que hay una revolución tecnológica de la mano de DeFi que llegó para quedarse y la educación es una pieza fundamental para la adopción temprana.

Por eso, hace un año y medio creé Blocklatina, un lugar donde poder volcar mi pasión por la enseñanza, para poner en lenguaje sencillo de qué se trata este fascinante mundo de las criptomonedas. 

No doy recomendaciones de inversión ni consejo financiero. En Blocklatina encontrarás herramientas y contenido de calidad acerca de la tecnología blockchain y finanzas descentralizadas, con tutoriales sencillos, explicaciones paso a paso,  entrevistas a personas destacadas de la comunidad y temas de actualidad.

The First Decentralized Revenue Aggregator

Zunami Protocol is the DAO that works with stablecoins and solves the main issues of current yield-farming protocols by streamlining interaction with DeFi, making it easier and cheaper while increasing profitability by differentiating and rebalancing users' funds.

Zunami Protocol is advancing on the DeFi market with one of the first automated asset managers. Our in-house solution, which only works with stablecoins, was released with the primary objective to create a safe and profitable alternative to traditional banking deposits.

DAO identifies the most profitable strategies, allowing holders to earn higher interest rates on their Tether (USDT), Dai (DAI) or USD Coin (USDC) stablecoins. Zunami Protocol solves the main issues of current yield-farming protocols by streamlining interaction with DeFi. Our proprietary solution uses less gas than through Curve-Convex, making it 4 times cheaper to interact through Zunami Protocol than directly. Zunami provides the best return on the market by automatically selling rewards and reinvesting the generated income.

We tackle the Problems:

Overcomplicated User Experience;
Self-managing of digital assets;
Expensive Interaction with DeFi;
Governance crisis.

We present a Solution:

Smooth & easy UI. The single pool system and new UI make interaction with DeFi apps smooth & easy by performing all the actions in one step!
Automated revenue aggregator. The revenue aggregator independently differentiates and rebalances funds among the best stablecoin pools based on the results of the weekly DAO voting. Delegate, automate, enjoy;
Cost optimization. Earned rewards are automatically sold and then reinvested so that users can enjoy the full power of compound interest. Transaction Streamlining Mechanism (TSM) significantly reduces deposit and withdrawal costs and makes yield-farming accessible not only for crypto whales;
DAO. Transparent solution of all key issues through voting by ZUN holders. The ZUN token will be credited through the innovative Lockdrop system to ensure the proper functioning of the platform in the long term!

Zunami Protocol proudly stands out as a high-end DeFi platform offering users a bunch of new features:

Rebalancing and Diversification. Using the Zunami Protocol, you get the best returns on the market while your funds are diversified across trusted pools and DApps. Decisions on the choice of strategy and assets rebalancing are made by the weekly voting of the DAO.

4041,climate-finance-dao,"What?

The Climate Finance DAO (@ClimatefinDAO) is an initiative aiming to support and develop climate science-informed & decentralised finance instruments. 

Why?

Limiting global temperature rise to below 1.5°C while achieving sustainable development will require trillions in new investments, and a rapid shift toward low carbon, climate-resilient economic and social models. Despite global climate finance flows reaching $632 billion in 2020, and market signals are just starting to reflect the urgency of making all financial flows consistent with the Paris Agreement, far more ambition is needed to address the climate crisis. 
The past decades have proved that centralised finance can only do so much, and this is where DAOs and decentralised finance (DeFi) instruments can add value. We need to step up. 

A potential grant will support the following efforts:

Work in Progress

1) Build human capital | core team: Kindly note that this is a work in progress now, and at this stage, we are building a core team to safely launch the @ClimatefinDAO, actively promote it in the relevant channels, and start onboarding interested people. 

2) Build awareness | digest: We will kick-start the @ClimatefinDAO digest in which we aim to blend different realms of climate science, climate finance & decentralised finance. This digest can bridge huge information, data and perspective gaps between these different domains. The digest will be an invaluable source for the community & ecosystem. 

3) Build instruments | decentralised climate finance: Once the core team is established and digest is kicked off, we will start baking new decentralised climate finance instruments where anyone can invest in the transition to low carbon and ultimately the net-zero world. We will also be seeking cooperation opportunities with relevant initiatives whereby possible and applicable.  

Disclaimer:
Kindly note that this is totally a voluntary initiative that has not been linked to any kind of early investment or is not affiliated with any institution. As in any DAOs, @ClimatefindAO belongs to all of its members and follows their collective visions.

2272,immunefi-whitehat-scholarship,"Update: Round 1 of the Whitehat Scholarship is now closed. We will be making an announcement on our Medium of the winners shortly.

DeFi is exploding in growth, but there aren’t enough Solidity developers or whitehat hackers to go around. From a development perspective, the DeFi ecosystem is being held back from its true potential, and from a security perspective, devastating hacks keep obliterating projects almost every week. 

We believe that it’s important for the DeFi community to contribute to the public good of upskilling whitehat hacking talent in the smart contract field. 

Since launching Immunefi, we’ve met many highly skilled hackers who want to hunt for bugs full-time as a career, but it feels too risky to leave their current jobs.

To get hackers bug hunting full-time, we’re launching the first round of the Whitehat Scholarship.

With help from:

- 30 contributors through Gitcoin grants
- A $5k contribution from Vesper
- And our own funds at Immunefi

The purpose of this scholarship is to help smart contract hackers who have proven themselves in the space to leave their full-time job and turn bug hunting into a full-time gig.

For the first round, we’re opening a public application for any smart contract hacker to apply for the scholarship. Based on the applications, Immunefi will pick up to 5 hackers for the first cohort, which will be awarded three months of salary covered by the scholarship to come hunt for bugs full-time.

Whitehats who receive the Whitehat Scholarship are expected to do two things:

- Hunt for bugs on the Immunefi platform 

- Spend some amount of time doing community work and creating educational resources, so that other aspiring bug hunters can learn how to hunt for the world's largest bounties 

For any bug bounties awarded to these hunters during that time, 30% of the rewards will be pledged to go back into the scholarship treasury, so that we can give other budding whitehats the same opportunity.

To apply, the only thing you need to do is hit the button below and fill out the application form. We’ll review applications as they come in, and the winners of the scholarship will be announced on this page after the 21st of May 2021.
Immunefi takes no cut of any donations, and is happy to administer this program as a public service to the community. 

If you have any questions regarding the scholarship, send us an email at scholarship@immunefi.com.

Preface
As the world becomes increasingly digital, cryptocurrency is a next natural step in the evolution of money. Pi is the first digital currency for everyday people, representing a major step forward in the adoption of cryptocurrency worldwide. 

Our Mission: Build a cryptocurrency and smart contracts platform secured and operated by everyday people.

Our Vision: Build the world’s most inclusive peer-to-peer marketplace, fueled by Pi, the world’s most widely used cryptocurrency

DISCLAIMER for more advanced readers: Because Pi’s mission is to be inclusive as possible, we’re going to take this opportunity to introduce our blockchain newbies to the rabbit hole :)

Introduction: Why cryptocurrencies matter
Currently, our everyday financial transactions rely upon a trusted third party to maintain a record of transactions. For example, when you do a bank transaction, the banking system keeps a record & guarantees that the transaction is safe & reliable. Likewise, when Cindy transfers $5 to Steve using PayPal, PayPal maintains a central record of $5 dollars debited from Cindy’s account and $5 credited to Steve’s. Intermediaries like banks, PayPal, and other members of the current economic system play an important role in regulating the world’s financial transactions.

However, the role of these trusted intermediaries also has limitations:

Unfair value capture. These intermediaries amass billions of dollars in wealth creation (PayPal market cap is ~$130B), but pass virtually nothing onto their customers - the everyday people on the ground, whose money drives a meaningful proportion of the global economy. More and more people are falling behind.
Fees. Banks and companies charge large fees for facilitating transactions. These fees often disproportionately impact lower-income populations who have the fewest alternatives.
Censorship. If a particular trusted intermediary decides that you should not be able to move your money, it can place restrictions on the movement of your money.
Permissioned. The trusted intermediary serves as a gatekeeper who can arbitrarily prevent anybody from being part of the network.
Pseudonymous. At a time when the issue of privacy is gaining greater urgency, these powerful gatekeepers can accidentally disclose -- or force you to disclose -- more financial information about yourself than you may want.

Bitcoin’s “peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” launched in 2009 by an anonymous programmer (or group) Satoshi Nakamoto, was a watershed moment for the freedom of money. For the first time in history, people could securely exchange value, without requiring a third party or trusted intermediary. Paying in Bitcoin meant that people like Steve and Cindy could pay each other directly, bypassing institutional fees, obstructions and intrusions. Bitcoin was truly a currency without boundaries, powering and connecting a new global economy.

Introduction To Distributed Ledgers
Bitcoin achieved this historical feat by using a distributed record. While the current financial system relies on the traditional central record of truth, the Bitcoin record is maintained by a distributed community of “validators,” who access and update this public ledger. Imagine the Bitcoin protocol as a globally shared “Google Sheet” that contains a record of transactions, validated and maintained by this distributed community. 

The breakthrough of Bitcoin (and general blockchain technology) is that, even though the record is maintained by a community, the technology enables them to always reach consensus on truthful transactions, insuring that cheaters cannot record false transactions or overtake the system. This technological advancement allows for the removal of the centralized intermediary, without compromising transactional financial security. 

Benefits Of Distributed Ledgers
In addition to decentralization, bitcoin, or cryptocurrencies in general, share a few nice properties that make money smarter and safer, although different cryptocurrencies may be stronger in some properties and weaker in others, based on different implementations of their protocols.  Cryptocurrencies are held in cryptographic wallets identified by a publicly accessible address, and is secured by a very strong privately held password, called the private key. This private key cryptographically signs transaction and is virtually impossible to create fraudulent signatures. This provides security and unseizability. Unlike traditional bank accounts that can be seized by government authorities, the cryptocurrency in your wallet can never be taken away by anyone without your private key. Cryptocurrencies are censorship resistant due to the decentralized nature because anyone can submit transactions to any computer in the network to get recorded and validated. Cryptocurrency transactions are immutable because each block of transactions represents a cryptographic proof (a hash) of all the previous blocks that existed before that. Once someone sends you money, they cannot steal back their payment to you (i.e., no bouncing checks in blockchain). Some of the cryptocurrencies can even support atomic transactions. “Smart contracts” built atop these cryptocurrencies do not merely rely on law for enforcement, but directly enforced through publicly auditable code, which make them trustless and can potentially get rid of middlemen in many businesses, e.g. Escrow for real estate. 

Securing Distributed Ledgers (Mining)
One of challenges of maintaining a distributed record of transactions is security -- specifically, how to have an open and editable ledger while preventing fraudulent activity. To address this challenge, Bitcoin introduced a novel process called Mining (using the consensus algorithm “Proof of Work”) to determine who is “trusted” to make updates to the shared record of transactions.

You can think of mining as a type of economic game that forces “Validators” to prove their merit when trying to add transactions to the record. To qualify, Validators must solve a series of complex computational puzzles. The Validator who solves the puzzle first is rewarded by being allowed to post the latest block of transactions. Posting the latest block of transactions allows Validators to “mine” a Block Reward - currently 12.5 bitcoin (or ~$40,000 at the time of writing).

3937,first-comprehensive-longevity-clinical-trial-in-h,"Hey everyone!
 
We’re excited to announce our first-ever Gitcoin Grant application.

With your help, we can accelerate the progress of longevity and help slow down the onset of age-related damage in millions of people. Help us gather more important data from the Rapamycin for longevity trial.

With the infrastructure set up, participants enrolled, and partnerships formed, more funding will allow us to gather more data, more biomarkers, and more insights. It would be a big waste of an opportunity to collect a limited amount of data due to the lack of a few hundred thousand dollars.

What is PEARL?

Participatory Evaluation of Aging with Rapamycin for Longevity Study is the first of its kind human subjects rapamycin trial. The trial is entirely funded by donations, with the intention of making all results public and advancing our understanding of longevity science.



Read about the background of the PEARL Trial and our initial crowdfunding round
Review PEARL study listing in National Library of Medicine
Learn more from our PEARL project page


Why are we excited about Rapamycin?

Rapamycin was the first molecule proven to extend the lifespan of a mammal/mouse, even when given late in life (Harrison, D., Strong, R., Sharp, Z. et al. 2009). It also has the potential to treat aging-related diseases (Blagosklonny, 2019) such as Alzheimer’s (Spilman P. et al. 2010) or heart disease, and not to mention, boost our immune system as well (Mannick JB. et al. 2014). It is by far the most studied longevity intervention after Calorie Restriction (CR).

Don’t just take our word for it, take a look at the discussion out there from people that are also excited about rapamycin.


Brian Armstrong


Peter Attia





What have we done so far?

We have been busy over the last 12 months preparing the infrastructure for the trial to be successful:

• Securing initial funding
• Setting up partnerships (Mayo Clinic, ISB Bioanalytica, TruDiagnostics, DexaFit, Thorne Health)
• Incorporating Feedback from Advisors (i.e Misha Blagosklony, Matt Kaeberlein, Dr. Alan Green)
• Enrolling trial participants

Now that the infrastructure is in place, we can collect a material amount of additional data with extra funding.

How Your Funds Will Make a Massive Difference

1. Optimize available blood tests for all of our participants
2. Expand the number of specialty blood tests.
3. Reinforce data collection in the dental space

           

What does this mean?

	1. Optimize available blood tests for all of our participants

At our current state, we’re able to run one of Olink’s Target 96 proteomic panels on Baseline, 6 months, and 12-month tissue samples for about 50 of our PEARL Participants. An additional $45,000 would allow us to expand these panels to our full Phase 1 cohort of 150 participants.

	2. Expand the number of specialty blood tests available

We’re very excited to bring proteomic analysis to the PEARL Trial. An additional $70,000 raised will allow a second Olink Target 96 panel to be run on all participant samples. This insight would generate data for over 41,000 protein biomarkers from our Phase 1 PEARL cohort. For every additional $70,000 raised, we will be able to greatly expand the proteomic data produced by PEARL.

	3. Reinforce data collection for dental health

Our current process requests PEARL participants to bring an approved dental form to their dental appointments throughout the PEARL trial. To further incentivize PEARL participants to participate in this aspect of the trial, we would like to offer $100 gift cards for returning their completed dental form. An additional $15,000 raised would guarantee our ability to offer this incentive. 


Why are these insights important?

Proteomics

This is important because protein biomarkers can provide valuable insights into age-related changes (Johnson A. et al. 2020) as well as provide a comprehensive picture of chronic inflammation (Furman D. et al. 2019), a driving force behind age-related deterioration – “inflamm-aging”. It will also allow us to study the effect on proteins associated with immune system pathways, which is particularly important given Rapamycin’s known impact on immune system function. Including these tests within PEARL will therefore allow us collectively to gain the maximum amount of information we can regarding both the efficacy and safety of Rapamycin dosing regimens.


Dental

With the work done by Kaeberlein et al. 2020, demonstrating rapamycin to rejuvenate oral health in mice, we see a great opportunity to collect data in human subjects with the PEARL Trial. These findings may prop up greater opportunity to continue rapamycin research in the dental space and contribute to our greater goal of accelerating progress of longevity research, as Gil-Montoya et al. 2015 suggest, “There is wide evidence that periodontitis is a risk factor for certain systemic diseases, and impaired oral health has been associated with mastication and nutritional problems, especially among the elderly, with highly negative effects on their quality of life.”.


Thank you on behalf of the entire AgelessRx team for your time and we greatly appreciate your support! We are excited to participate in Gitcoin Round 13.

206,poplocker,"PopLocker is an Ethereum DApp browser / wallet and an alternative to Metamask. The desktop version is live on mainnet (http://poplocker.io/) and was funded by a grant from the Ethereum Foundation.

PopLocker is currently a desktop browser extension — although in the future, it will be a dedicated browser on both desktop and mobile.

PopLocker is targeted at a mainstream audience with a focus on simplicity and adoption. All a user needs to create an account is a password — which is used to encrypt a private key in the extension’s storage. There are no seed phrases or private keys exposed to users and indeed no private key or seed phrase ever leaves the device. Instead, once a user has some ETH, they are able to backup their account by upgrading it to a SmartLocker. These are non-custodial smart contract wallets that allows users to link multiple devices to the same account by using meta-transactions and gas relayers. By upgrading to SmartLockers users can access a single account/identity on the Ethereum network from multiple devices — this also provides backup, if one device is lost then the user has other devices that can access their funds.",https://medium.com/poplocker,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,https://github.com/gtlewis,1
516,interspacechat,"Interspace.chat

Online video chat is awesome and can help distributed communities in their communication and coordination. Yet there is something inherently cold about the blandness of current solutions. For remote teams to work together human interaction can be fostered by making nicer and more functional online spaces for virtual conferences and hackathons.

Creation
interspace.chat was originally created in 2019 for hackalong02 (http://liminalvillage.com/#hackalongs) as a first implementation of a video chat application with persistant rooms. In that first version, it was ""merely a room selector"" for jitsi video conference calls made with ReactJS. This decreased access difficulty for users to a high degree.

Implementations
Visit an interspace for yourself! The following deployments of interspace.chat are currently available:
https://interspace.chat - links to individual portals and free individual rooms. 
https://noncon.interspace.chat - Parallele Polis NONCON virtual conference
https://interspace.metagame.wtf - Metagame

Interspace.chat - The Next Generation
In the current “lockdown and quarantine” atmosphere with collaborative events getting cancelled left, right and center, combined with our experience with three implementations so far, we’re looking to launch interspace.chat to the next level, in order to provide the “commons” a well-documeted “turnkey” software stack and standardized deployment pipeline for any community that wants to produce / host a virtual event.

The tools and processes created by Kolektivo aim to create a prosperous economy that can provide a social foundation for all its citizens while minimizing the negative ecological impact. 

🌱 In this cycle, we're exploring the potential of community-owned assets and NFTs to fund regenerative development on the island. We're crowdsourcing funds to create the first community-owned food forest in Curaçao. 

Click here 👈🏽 to learn more about the Kolektivo Food Forest
Click here 👈🏽 Back the project by getting 1 of the 40 Food Forest NFTs 

How we got here
After months of preparation, we launched the CuraDAO pilot in August 2019 together with DAOstack. CuraDAO consisted of over 40 individual community members on the island who coordinated social-impact projects through the CuraDAO DAPP. The pilot was successfully concluded in December 2019 after 9 projects being funded and organized through CuraDAO. One of the biggest issues we ran into during the pilot was that most locals don't understand how to value cryptocurrencies. In February 2020, we created CuraDAI, a DAI-backed stablecoin that matches the local currency's value, the Antillean Guilder, to solve this problem. CuraDAO started to evolve into more than just a coordination hub with a community currency attached to it - it started to become an economy. We iterated on this idea during the Kickstart Innovation, the island's local hackathon organized by the ministry of economic development, and won! This signaled that the ecosystem is ready for the next step - scaling from the ~100 individuals who interacted with CuraDAO/CuraDAI to 1000s of individuals who participate. For this level of adoption to be reached, we need to sharpen our vision, improve the technology, and get even more embedded into the local ecosystem.

Our vision 
Kolektivo will merge all learnings and resources into a single user-friendly solution that all stakeholders can interact with and collectively coordinate through. The solution will leverage the latest insights in community currency and DAOs to create a prosperous economy that rewards social-impact initiatives fairly for their impact on the island. Once successful in Curaçao, we hope to support other countries and regions in creating their own Kolektivo economy!

What you'll be funding!
The creation of the first digital community asset project in the Caribbean: The Kolektivo Food Forest.
The development of Kolektivo - this includes creating the Kolektivo DAPP on the Fuse platform, the coordination of projects, and the establishment of local and international partnerships.
Supporting local social impact projects that are funded through CuraDAO. This could range from Clean-ups organized by teens to local innovation collectives being launched. 

Our partners
We're extremely grateful to be working with some of the most passionate teams and advanced permissionless technologies in the space and on the island. Together we are Kolektivo!

We partnered with Gitcoin to launch a climate pool as part of their new Grant Round (GR12), a $250k quadratic funding pool to support projects that address the climate emergency (donate!)
We started our first mirror crowdfunding for THE WEEK. A documentary series to mobilize for the climate emergency, produced by Frédéric Laloux (author of the bestseller book “Reinventing Organizations” that is inspiring many DAOs today) and Hélène Gérin.
We keep a directory of climate justice related crypto projects and DAOs (see our current Twitter List)
We help movements for the climate use web3

Who we are
We are a growing community of active citizens that take initiatives in our communities to transition to a more sustainable world. Some of us organize marches for the climate, others start community gardens, reclaim the public space, make movies, make art. Some create mutual aid funds to help their community after a natural disaster, others build software, ... We are all hummingbirds doing our part and we are coming together here to support each other.

See also our shared values and principles.

Where we are going
We see a lot of people burn out while doing community work and activism. In other words, while fighting for a more sustainable planet, they are not sustainable themselves. This needs to change. Our planet depends on citizens waking up and taking action, in whatever way they feel is necessary, answering to a local need. Our mission is to find a reward system to make activism and community work regenerative. We need to bring community life back to the center of our lives. It will save us.

Activism is a public good, and we need to fund it as such. 

Where we started
Many of us ran into the issue of collecting and disbursing money as a collective. It is not sustainable to create a non profit entity with a bank account for every single initiative. That’s why we created a shared non profit “All for Climate” that all of us can use to raise money, get our expenses reimbursed, apply for funding, etc. Today there are more than 160 collectives hosted by All for Climate. www.allforclimate.earth

If you are not a crypto whale, but still racked up a lot of transactions: you cannot afford to spend $2-4k on crypto tax services.
But now you can use HODL Totals as an approachable DIY crypto taxes solution.

By funding this grant you are helping crypto go mainstream. Increased funding will speed-up the building of HODL Totals: free and open-source Google Sheet tools that aim remove the FUD around crypto taxation.

Our approach is not to give people another service to hire, but rather teach people to instead count on themselves to come into compliance with tax laws and regulations. Anything is possible if you have the right tools and a strong community to help.

""Finished calculating all my crypto taxes with your extension...
      worked like a charm :)
             would have been hell without this!""

                    - cejennings5, 02/25/2022
 
We believe in solutions grounded in the open internet, with code that is open source and available under the MIT License. Unlike the software used by many other crypto service companies, our source code is public so you can actually download and take a look at the code to see how it works.

Your transaction data is… well yours. You should have a say in what happens to it. Acknowledging that you need to pay taxes should not force you to surrender that data to a crypto tax service. I prefer my crypto data not sitting in a honeypot that could be hacked, like this service in August 2020. That doesn’t mean you have to live off the grid in a cabin in the woods. With HODL Totals you can choose to put your trust in Google Drive’s secure data centers with encrypted storage and in exchange you get a cloud-based user experience that makes crypto tax preparation less painful.

The HODL Totals Google Sheet Add-On helps users capture:
Transaction Dates
Transaction IDs
Coin amount inflows
Coin amount outflows
Pricing data
Wallet information
Cryptocurrency Addresses

After capturing this data in a HODL Totals sheet, our JavaScript scripts execute upon your data in order to provide you with useful computations. Our Google Apps Scripts will add menu commands to the Google Sheet that will help you track cost basis and long-term or short-term treatment for your cryptocurrency trades. It uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method, which is commonly used for tax compliance. 

We calculate:
Profit and loss
Short-term capital gains
Long-term capital gains
Overall coin totals

The initial prerelease version of our tool is working and has assisted people with their 2020 US income taxes. However, there are plenty of rough edges and additional functionality to add if this tool is going to reach the audience we want to reach.

Update 3/08/2022
* still finishing up a number of minor bugs before putting HODL Totals finally up on the Google Add-on Marketplace
* added short tutorials with screenshots for use in Discord
* shared a release candidate version with latest features & bug fixes for folks to use for 2021 tax prep until we get in the Marketplace (link to this found in the #setup channel of our discord)

Our genesis drop project will be a NFT collection focused on mermaids called CyberMermaids.  Mermaids have been known as mysterious creatures that have captured our curiosity for thousands of years. Enchanting, mysterious, adventurous, and explorer stories of them have been told from Africa to China to ancient Greece. They have been part of our youth and continue on to adulthood. Mermaids symbolize Decentralization to us; they live by no rules, free to roam the open sea, true to themselves.  

This will be our first Gitcoin Round, and we are very excited about this.

Your support/contribution will lead to the following milestones:
Launching of the CyberMermaid Collection
Creating a Dope Sea Metaverse to showcase all collections 
Building the Dope Sea website and Discord 
Educating the community to inspire compassionate action for the ocean and sea creatures

We love this ecosystem and the community building it.  Together we can preserve our ocean and our future.

3522,krebit-web3-verifiable-credentials,"How can we unlock reputation from centralized platforms, for global talent, so they can earn by merit and keep their privacy? 

Krebit makes Web3 Identity more trustworthy, meritocratic and privacy-preserving, by providing fully decentralized, community-verified credentials.

Krebit.id is an open identity verification protocol, DAO and marketplace for Web3 Verifiable Credentials made by Issuers about off-chain Claims stored in Ceramic, and registered on-chain in the KRB reputation token.  


I. Vision:
Decentralized Reputation (DeRep) has great challenges: sovereign-identities, reputation calculation, sybil attacks, governance, vote buying, vote swings, vote apathy, plutocracy, etc. Krebit mitigates all of them and creates a pseudonymous economy for users to prove things about them without revealing any unnecessary information.

Our vision is to become the preferred public platform to verify the reputation of all members of the Web3 community.

II. Login with Wallet to a DID
Krebit will reuse your Ceramic's Self.ID Decentralized Identity (DID) for login with either Metamask or a Non-Custodial local storage wallet. Self.ID is a multi-platform identity protocol for web3 decentralized and portable user profiles. DIDs enable entities to prove control over them by authenticating using cryptographic proofs such as digital signatures. An example of a DID is “did:example:123456abcdef”.

 
III. Manage Identity Claims off-chain
A claim is a statement about a subject, e.g. about their identity, location, accomplishments, owned property, etc. With Krebit the user private claim data remains off-chain in the Ceramic Network encrypted and controlled by their Self.ID DID. 

 


After a user manages their claim information, they can request judgement from a verifier based on a fee that they are willing to pay. 

 


IV. Issue Verifiable Credentials with EIP712-VC  sdk
Verified Credentials are attestations made by issuers on users' claims.  A verifier with enough $KRB Tokens validates the data, signs the Verifiable Credential and sends attestation. 

 
  

V. Register Verifiable Credentials on-chain
Krebit offers a W3C Verifiable Credentials marketplace, where both users and attestators are rewarded when they are registered On-Chain in the $KRB Token ethereum smart contract.

$KRB is an ERC-20 Token with OpenZepellin's extensions to make it Mintable/Burnable or Cyclical. It also limits tokens to only be transferable between accounts with a min balance, to encourage reputation building.

 


VI. Using Credentials to improve the Web3 experience
A lot of new use cases are unlocked by using credentials, for example we have implemented a demo using a Discord Bot to claim member Roles based on credentials:


VII. Dispute resolution via DAO
Any member can also dispute a Verifiable Credential via proposal on the Krebit DAO. Once raised, disputes must be resolved by voting and the $KRB rewards could get burnt and the verifier’s stake could get slashed. Krebit Inc. (a Delaware S Corp) operates the Krebit DApp, is one of many issuers in the marketplace, and promotes the Krebit DAO.


VII. Web3 Stack:
Krebit is not going to reinvent the wheel. Instead, we intend to use the best existing tools and best practices for each component of the architecture. We're building on top of @ethereum @IPFS @ceramicnetwork @textileio & @graphprotocol




And with Krebit, existing identity claims and scores from other platforms (i.e. BrightID, PoH, POAP, tc.) could also be aggregated as W3C verifiable credentials.

Aleph.im core

Serverless Computing
Serverless File Storage
Serverless Database
Secure Trustless Data Management

Thanks to cross-chain interoperability of Aleph.im's scalable p2p database, network dApp builders will enjoy instant access to decentralized databases in the preferred language.
Our goal is to facilitate performance and user experience of decentralized applications on par with those of centralized solutions. dApp users will see a dramatic improvement in processing speed. We are all familiar with high traffic on-chain processing congestion problems. Aleph.im users will not encounter these problems since Aleph.im users pay no Gas fees and therefore don’t need to wait for payment confirmations.
Data is only replicated between as many nodes as needed to guarantee data availability. By using this approach we improve scalability by several factors.
Cross-Chain: Aleph.Im supports user-specific storage and encryption and is compatible with multiple blockchains. This also enables decentralized identity services to all connected blockchain dApps.
By offering a Single Identity Solution with blockchain addresses we can resolve the silo issues of the web as the user maintains full control of sharing or reuse of their data. The user is and will stay the owner of their data.
All our code is open source from top to bottom: https://github.com/aleph-im/

606,defi-indonesia,"DeFi Indonesia is a community to foster #Decentralized Finance movement in Indonesia. This community is committed to DeFi / Open Finance education and knowledge sharing in Indonesia local community, serving 264 million people. It also encourages and promotes DeFi usage and development throughout collaboration. 

We are challenging to current DeFi community problems that most of DeFi activities and developments centered around developed countries such as the US and Western Europe whereas low visibility and exposure in developing countries. 

One of the core values of DeFi is it’s permission-less entry where anyone even those who cannot access to traditional finance can interact and enjoy the power of finance. This situation is relatively more severe in emerging countries. For example, in Indonesia there are still 66% of the population are under-served to banking access.

Currently main challenges in Indonesia is that very little people know DeFi in Indonesia. Thus we as a DeFi Indonesia would like to drive awareness of DeFi in wider Indonesian local community. 

■ Objectives 

Spreading awareness of DeFi to a wider community
Facilitating collaboration and development of DeFi
Growing together for nurturing a helpful community 

■ Our Activity

#DeFi Indonesia consists of mainly three activities 

1. Event and conference 
Event and conference is an offline grassroots movement strongly aligned with the aforementioned purpose. Events cover education focused seminar for DeFi newbies, collaborative development activities such as hackathon or hands-on workshop.

We have recently held a pilot education event for local community with a support of MakerDAO. Video can be found here. https://youtu.be/o4dwmflSx0k

2. Online DeFi forum 
Online forum is where people learn and teach each other, share exciting DeFi news and some useful information and discuss anything DeFi related topics. We have already our telegram group.

3. DeFi educational materials in bahasa Indonesia 
Educational contents and newsletter is crucial for #DeFi Indonesia in order to reach a wider audience for more and better understanding on DeFi in Indonesia. Currently there is almost none DeFi information served in Bahasa Indonesia and not so many people are literate in English in Indonesia. With this fund we will make educational materials. 


■ Fund usage

With this fresh fund, we would like to start creating our own website and DeFi education contents in Indonesian language in order to cater to local community. It will explain fundamental knowledge about DeFi and help new learners gain a right information about DeFi. Fund is used for paying remuneration to contents writers and translators and website hosting fee. 

■ Members 

Our members are experienced in community building.

Mayato Hattori is a founder of DeFi Japan and is used to work at OmiseGO as a community manager of blockchain community space in Tokyo. He also helped coordinating local side of Devcon 5 in Osaka last year. 

Danny Taniwan is a blockchain evangelist in Indonesian local community. He has been helping many projects and dedicated into crypto education and regulation in Indonesia. He is also a founder of Cryptowatch, local community for learning.

2248,dadas-invisible-economy,"DADA is an online platform where people around the world create spontaneous visual conversations together, in spite of language, distance, nationality, or other artificial boundaries. It’s a free and liberating experience. Artists are not motivated by money, but by intrinsic rewards.
 
DADA launched the first decentralized art marketplace in Ethereum in 2017. With 130K drawings made on the platform we hold the largest digital art collection in the world ready to be traded as NFTs. But we have been intentional about focusing our efforts not on sales, but on creating an egalitarian economic system that protects people’s intrinsic motivations.
 
The Invisible Economy is the radical separation of art and the market. In DADA, art is never sold or commodified in any way, and there are no speculative secondary markets. Everyone contributes doing what they love, art making, code writing, curating, art collecting, motivated by intrinsic rewards. The action in and of itself is its own reward, and each action mints Dada tokens.

Dada's Invisible Economy is being created by a community of artists and technologists that are reinventing art on the blockchain to foster creativity first, and create collective long term wealth through the commons.

100% of funds collected will go to DADA's community fund.

Since last round:

🏹💘 We have launched a marketplace for the DADA Creeps & Weirdos collections.  Here's some thoughts on DADAkin's sense making and an inside story on what rare art is, how slow markets are to catch up with innovation, and royalties (old world artefact) 

🚀🌌 We have created a wrapper for our 2017 modified ERC-20 tokens (Creeps) and the 2019 tokens (Weirdos).

🎨📇🔗 Stay tuned for an intergalactic conceptual token art piece that will carve the current of our sensemaking and history in this space  on our voyage to the next galaxy.  Hint: the future is DAO.

718,dao-a-user-owned-social-platform,"Social platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Wechat are all owned by its founders and investors. 

However, a social network should really be owned by its users. 

I want to create a social network platform owned by its users, governed by its users and for the users. 

Background: 

This project can be dated back to mid 2018 when we tried to build the concept to a new blockchain called Genesis Space. It failed due to technology unreadiness. Then we tried twice to build a DApp with the same idea. The first one (early 2019) also failed and the second one (late 2019) went online. However, due to technical restrictions, the performance of the DApp is very poor. As an IM, it was not ready for mass adoption. I was very dissatisfied of it and decided to start from scratch. This time we have made some compromises as well as numerous improvements to the concept. For now the final product will be a website. We should be launching it in the next a few weeks. (Tentative url: chatdao.com)

Product:

GROUP: 
In DAO, users belong to different groups. Within a group, people can post whatever they like, just like a Wechat Group or Facebook Group. 

GROUP LEADER: 
Each group has a group leader. This group leader is responsible for setting up the rules for the group and executing them. Group leader can even issue a token as reward for user behaviors, such as rewarding users for posting/commenting etc. 

GOVERNANCE:
A group leader has all the power in the group. A group leader can either be the person who created the group or be someone elected by all users in the group. 

DECENTRALIZATION:
DAO is a company registered in the United States. Each year, 80% of its profits from all sources will be shared by the group leaders. The remaining 20% will go to its founders, developers and investors.

1838,real-estate-token,"I'm about to build a house for multiple families, I have enough assets and a traditional loan for it is secured. It's still in early planing phase.
But I don't want to support traditional banks and love cryptos, so maybe it's time for something new.

The Plan
is to raise money for the first property of many more and give out a Token that is coupled to a fraction of the property and income.
In other words if you invest, you own a part of the property, get paid by tenants, while me and my wife will take care of everything. 
You will be able to reinvest the monthly rent back in new property projects, or in whatever you want. We plan to pay out in ETH and other coins with lower transaction fees.

The return
a multifamily home now costs about 750k$ - 1mil$ +.
Thanks to inflation and limited space will the value increase over time and if it burns down, the insurance will pay. 
In addition, we will yield about 4-7% rent per year.
Depending on how much leverage we will use on the first project, 5x to 10x are normal.
Let's say we use 5x and it costs 750k, I will put in at least 100K, so I will own 500K of the 750K property. 
After building phase the property value will increase, lets say 1mil, then my tokens will be worth 666K. 
If you want to sell your coins in the future, we will buy back your coins based on the current market value of the property and as much as the monthly cashflow allows, then the tokens will be equally shared among all holders.
And in times of uniswap, it's only a matter of time until you can trade the tokens. It Will be interesting where the crypto trading community could see such a token. 
Maybe moon territory, But you can buy it at building costs. 

Team and Disclaimer
I'm a random anon with an idea and the required know how, but to be honest, you shouldn't trust any anon with your money. 
But if you have a little trust and risk capital left over today, you could help an anon back another successful crypto project.
At the moment there's no website or anything else shiny to convince you, but if I get a little financial feedback I will build the project website, legal stuff and set up a Token. 
We will also make a video series of our building project soon

501,covid-19-tracker-with-latest-updates-news-article,"Greetings Everyone,

I'm a 17 year old college student. My country forced the educational sector to be closed due to COVID-19 Concerns. So during this time, I started work on this Coronavirus Statistics tracker.

The data is obtained from Trusted and Reliable sources, all of which are listed in the footer of the website. The data is updated regularly and as fast as possible to provide the latest information to all users.

My goals with this website were as follows :

Compile all publicly available information into a single package.
Make the website easy to use.
Make sure the website looks attractive and easy on the eyes.
Provide all useful & necessary information up-front, So that users won't have to dig in for it.
Make sure the website loads fast for everyone & doesn't crash from high traffic.

I received help from my older brother in hosting this website.

I've implemented Graphs based on the data I have to visualize :

The Growth of the Virus over time (Infections, Deaths, Critical Cases, Recoveries)
The Infection Distribution across the countries (Countries Affected worst by the virus)
A World Map model pointing out all the regions affected by the virus.

I've added a Live News section in the footer which features the latest posted articles from many different sources which involve the coronavirus. The sources are credited in the More section.

Some more features I've added to this tracker are :

Country Specific information can be seen by hovering over the country (Pressing on Mobile)
Detailed Country Specific Information along with Graphs by clicking the chart icon.
Use arrows to visualize the Increase/Decrease in Infections/Deaths.
Calculate the Increase/Decrease percentages of the cases.
Real-time calculation of Death Rate & Recovery Rate based on Closed Cases.
Real-time calculation of Mild Cases to Critical Cases based on Active Cases.
A little Stopwatch that indicates how long it has been since the outbreak.

State-Wise Data is available for :

The United States of America ( County Wise Data is also Available )
Canada
The United Kingdom (Soon)
More to come

Browser Addon :

I've finished work on A Browser Addon for this website that shows you the most important latest statistics immediately with the press of a button in your Browser Menu.
The browser extension fetches the latest available data immediately on the press of a click and It presents it in an easy-to-read fashion.
It also includes the light theme with the Epic Theme Toggle animation :)

Risk Assessment :

I have a lot of free-time at my hands right now. The Virtual Classes will not be started for a long time, So I plan on using this time to implement more useful tools in this website to help everyone during this outbreak.

I'm currently working on a Risk Assessment test. It's not supposed to give you any Medical Advice. It asks you general questions about your daily life, your country, your travel habits, your physical health, your interaction with people, your visits to public places, your visits to hospitals, if you're experiencing any symptoms or not and determines how high at risk are you.

It features an entire page with the latest updated information from The WHO, CDC & other sources and informs you about the best practices to follow during this pandemic.

I also plan on adding a page where the false information about the Coronavirus is debunked.

Public Resources :

1.) https://public.coronastats.co :

This is a sub-domain where I plan to upload many public resources for everyone to use.
Currently the only resources I've uploaded here is Mini.json which is a very small static json file which is updated automatically. It includes the major and the most important data fragments about the coronavirus.

2.) Embeddable IFRAME :

https://public.coronastats.co/iframe.html for more information.

My plan is to implement more useful features, make more public tools and spread more awareness about the coronavirus.

These efforts will build on the Conviction Voting cadCAD model, a digital twin that is used to test & validate the safety of new continuous governance tools for managing communal funding pools.

This model is an important addition in applied complex systems engineering, forming the foundation for additional features to be built towards more robust DAO simulation and testing. It also standardizes new cadCAD model structure best practices, so it is an important educational tool to learn how to structure a cadCAD model for your DAO/token ecosystem.

Priority features for modeling: 
Analysis of $HNY issuance models
Addition of secondary market dynamics (e.g. Uniswap trading)
Collecting real world data from the 1Hive ecosystem to feed live data into the model for Computer Aided Governance via a real-time analytics dashboard
Include parameter sweeps & A/B tests for specific system tests
Including token mixing between participants, and other improvements to match model to reality

2460,let-anyone-write-smart-contracts,"
The purpose of they grant is to fund the development of a  toolbox of components for our No-Code  platform that  can be connected on an art-board to create new complex applications such as payment, reward , remittance, insurance  Thus letting those  with no technical background build sophisticated apps by connecting our custom components as well as relayers, wallets, safes, bridges, swaps, yields.... even defining the logic within the applications. 

A No-Code approach to software development is increasingly expected.  

“By 2024, low-code application development will be responsible for more than 65% of application development activity.”
-Gartner






Such a toolbox  will increase the number of buildings on blockchain by 1000 fold by letting  non-techies create new sophisticated blockchain applications using drag/drop interface (see video) to connect components. They can create complex applications in payment, reward, insure-tech, remittances... and many more. 

No-Node can be the jet fuel for blockchain adoption. Blockchain is a network without a network effect because of its lack of interoperability.  No-Code will help blockchain fulfill its purpose of bringing equality to under developed continents like Africa and India  by allowing  people to  develop their own blockchain applications, food safety, payment apps, remittence, cold chain, without needing to give up their independence to large first world corporations. 




 


#1 This will create a new layer of value consisting of these connected components and a stronger influence of Metcalf's laws on the network effect that will raise  the value of all blockchain apps apps.

#2  We will stop thinking of blockchain protocols as rigid one-size-fits-all solutions and start to think of protocols as a toolbox of components that can be configured, perhaps on the fly, to create custom solutions to diverse sets of problems. Users of blockchain will find a richer ecosystem and a toolbox in which they can build solutions to their problems with costs of their product proportional to the labor costs of the regions in which they happen to live.

 
ABOUT US
Our team of 12 has spent 2.5 years building a No-Code platform for blockchain and the link below shows the result. We want to build a toolbox of components that ""Citizen Programmers"" can use to build advanced applications like to handle payments, rewards, affiliate payment and many many others. 

We believes technology should unite and not divide us. We strive to democratize technology by simplifying it so that innovation happens across all strata of society. Our vision will be realized when any sized company, from enterprise to a small business owner, or even a single person with a yen to create, can innovate solutions to their problems.  

Because of the steep learning curve and scarcity of talent with the technology, blockchain can benefit greatly through the use of No-Code to simplify on-ramping, automation and protocol development. Moreover No-Code will raise the value of existing protocols by a factor of N^2 ( Metcalfe's Law) while reshaping our visions of the DApp from rigid one size fits all applications to highly flexible components that can be composed by naive users to create highly customized protocols to meet their unique requirements for payment - loyalty, reward, affiliate payment, and many more.  

 


 

This grant proposal will continue the work funded by this grant  by extending the  IDE and framework to take the pain out of building Web 3.0 interfaces and be the Wix or Squarespace of  the Web 3.0 world . In this proposal we build on our previous work to further  support the creator economy by allowing  customization of the visual appearance ;  supporting transparent DApp-to-blockchain integration through a novel concept we call Rule-of-Law by Code-is-Law;  and include a  full deployment infrastructure that supports teleporting between metaverses and support for a massively parallel “multiplayer”  applications.  

Why Metaverse 
The decision to continue using the metaverse paradigm for DApps was informed by our UX research that  showed a metaverse is a superior interface for  conveying complex processes to users or requiring users to make decisions with more than 3  input factors.  We believe that multiverses will become the dominant interface for Web 3.0. Our tests have shown clear evidence that those individuals who live in developing countries and have spent limited time on the internet benefit and/or  may not have limited access to a  secondary education can benefit  greatly from using a metaverse interface where  applications contain multi-step processes such as supply chain management, insurtech, remittances, etc.

Summary of Deliverables

The optimization of a proven algorithm that can be run by a single smart contract to perform context specific logic at a cost that is independent of the total size of the aggregate logic. This removes the limitation on using a smart contract that prevents them from being used to handle all the value transactions in a metaverse. 
A method to catalog smart contract logic as skeuomorphic metaverse “laws” and assign them to visual components using declarative or imperative semantics. 
A version 2.0 of our IDE will be the Wix or Squarespace for Web 3.0, making it economically viable to build ad multiverses on any scale. Support for teleportation between multiverses to provide a seamless experience as though traveling through one overarching metaverse.  

What Can be built using Metaverse Builder 
With a low budget, short amount of time and limited expertise a large variety of applications can be built. These include applications that contain processes around exchanges of value. 

Brand Loyalty and Rewards - Large brands, not eager to direct their customers to the mega metaverse(s), will launch campaigns and loyalty programs based on a gamifications that combines customer actions like purchases,and achieve game objectives like new level that grants special perks such as discounts, line-skipping, or NFT ownership. 

NFT Sales and Trading - NFT Collections will want to set up their own marketplaces where they can sell, or trade their NFTs in ways that are unique to their collection. Trading baskets of NFTs, discounts for early purchasers, etc… Every NFT Collection can have its OpenSea. 

Supply Chain Management/Food Traceability - Metaverses become an ideal metaphor for explaining complex processes such as Supply Chain Management, Food Traceability, etc. Our experience (described below) has shown that a metaverse model of a complex Food Traceability application can be intuitively understood by individuals with little or to no education. (see attached case study).

DeFi/Insuretech - Multiple stage defi operations such as lending and insurance will be represented as a metaverse game. Apps such as DeFiLand7  have already entered this space. 

Sports - The rich emursive possibilities of sport along with the strong competition between branding will make Ad Hoc metaverses a strong fit for clubs and teams. Sports oriented games like fantasy football will be an attractive target. 

Virtual Work - People confined or marginalized by reality are likely to be the first adopters of virtual experiences in the metaverse. Metaverses will allow people from locations in the Global South to find jobs all over the world. 

Replacement for Web 2.0 Websites - The Metaverse paradigm is now a credible candidate for being the interface of Web 3.0. The obvious impediment to realizing this status is the difficulty of building a metaverse as compared to building a Web 2.0 website. Another obstacle is that the emursive nature of the metaverse requires the ability to customize to the objectives and audience of retail, fintech, NFT sales… Metaverse Builder solves these problems in a way that will let it become the fulfillment of Web 3.0.


Hi-Res vs. Low-Res 
The world of metaverses can be divided into low-res metaverses such as Second Life, Minecraft and Roblox and high-res such as Somnium Space. Our technology can be applied equally to both a high-res and low-res metaverse. We have selected a middle of the road approach for our metaverse builder, informed by our UX research for maximizing 
decision making efficiency for an audience that includes a wide range of education levels and backgrounds. Much of our work has involved working with small landholder farmers who still struggle with limited network bandwidth and often a lack of experience with using the internet. 

List of Platform Benefits  
Some of the benefits to user of the Metaverse Launchpad include: 
Removal of the barriers that prevent smart contracts being used for ALL value exchanges  in the metaverse. 
Faster time to market for building metaverses
Lower cost for building metaverses
Rule of Law by Code is Law ROLCIL (described in detail below) 
Ability to Collect all “laws” of the metaverse into a one legal library.
Laws can be subject to governance and added in incrementally anytime. 
Laws can be associated with visual assets or asset types, e.g., land can be owned, rented… Bridges have tolls
Supports aggregating metaverses through user teleportation
Support for tracking assets associated with users when teleporting between metaverses
Ability to cost effectively build ad hoc metaverses for marketing campaigns, etc…
Ability to do rapid prototyping 
Ability to design, test and deploy domain specific UX designs
The ability to enrich and extend the laws of the metaverse over time
Laws in the metaverse can be declarative or imperative 

No walled-garden s
Unlike the real world, in the metaverse the blockchain is not limited by a walled garden that separates the digital and physical world. With the removal of this walled garden, entirely new internet-native free-market economies can be set up and monetized in the physical world but still be free from capital controls and prohibitively high banking fees.  

“Crypto cloud economies are the next emerging market investment frontier and the Metaverse is at the forefront of this Web 3.0 internet evolution… At this inflection point, leading Web 2.0 tech companies will likely need to start exploring the Metaverse to stay competitive, and the spotlight has prompted a new wave of investment in this emerging crypto category.”

4240,moonjelly-the-dao-for-the-ocean,"What is Moonjelly?

Moonjelly is a DAO for the Ocean. We are on a mission to increase the volume, speed, efficiency and transparency of funding flowing to ocean impact projects.

We will achieve this by creating a decentralized autonomous organisation focused on supporting its members with knowledge, connections and financial incentives to evolve into Ocean Stewards that will help vet Ocean Impact Projects. Those projects will then be able to launch on our Steward-curated platform and apply for funding, verify delivered impact, and sell achieved impact on the first Ocean Impact Marketplace.

Our methods are similar to Gitcoin, but with the objective of decentralizing ocean conservation. We reward community members for educating themselves on how to properly vet conservation projects and verify their impact. Members who have helped vet a project will become co-owners of the impact, and have a chance to earn on future sales of the impact NFT created after the project has finished.

The MVP Marketplace is currently in its design phase and will be launching in late May. Once this is done we will be launching our JELLY Token and the Moonjelly Treasury, and, towards the end of the year, launch the grants part of our ecosystem.

If you would like to read more about our project and overall roadmap, be sure to check out our website and concept paper. Reach out to us on Discord, Twitter or Telegram if you have any questions, or connect with each team member directly through LinkedIn - links below.

Who are we?

We are a team of proven pioneers working full time on the project. The Moonjelly core team members are a group of world renowned ocean scientists, movie producers, brand professionals and web3 experts. Our previous work ranges from having produced several ocean conservation documentaries on Netflix (Chasing Corals and Mission Blue), led the creative direction of adidas globally, and published several scientific papers on ocean science. We are in this for the long run, and see Moonjelly as a real opportunity to make real change in the ocean conservation space and close the financial gap to save our ocean.

Greenpoint Land Reserve (GLR) is a nonprofit Sphere of the Movement DAO. Acting in the best interests of DAO, GLR has assembled a team to start building the DAO Controlled Land Trust, a leverage-able tool that is owned and managed by the DAO. Our mission is to place thousands of acres of land worldwide into this land trust, effectively locking land up in the first-of-its-kind land preservation and conservation system. We have been working to create a bridge from the Ethereum metaverse to the real world. 

Land Management and Field Operations

GLRs plan for land management and field operations is two-fold. Acquiring land and sustainably monetizing that land. So, what does that mean? Let us start with land acquisitions. ETH generated from our token sale will fund the purchase of the different land assets initially in the United States. This land, transferred into the Greenpoint Land trust, names the DAO as benefactor and GLR as trustee.

We’ve been working on different models and partnering with some fantastic companies to build a holistic approach when dealing with each land asset. Early on, we realized the value generated by each parcel of land increases as its socio-economic impact on the surrounding community increases. By looking at both the land and surrounding areas, we can mold our approach to best create value. Whether in a metro area with a vertical farm that produces fresh vegetables and jobs or large-scale carbon-sequestering projects that generate carbon credits, large-scale fruit production, nut harvesting, and hardwood production. Our plans are all geared toward the public good.

Finally, by streamlining valuable local supply chains, we hope to build a lasting benefit to the surrounding communities. Farm to table, or possibly even solar or wind farm to home, we create an environment mutually beneficial for all involved.


Impact Investing: Introducing Proof of Acre
Proof of ACRE is a revolutionary new protocol that will pay rewards from funds generated by operations on land in the trust and Onsite ETH2 POS nodes.

Rollout soft date: Live

ACRE Token

At launch, the ACRE Token will facilitate the purchase and development of the first lands. 

ETH buys ACRE, ACRE converts to TOTEM, TOTEM earns MVT, the Greenpoint contract and Uniswap markets buy MVT for ETH. Convert back and forth from TOTEM to ACRE depending on earning potential. At the moment, the contract will buy at 0.0002 ETH per MVT. The next increase will be 0.00060 ETH Jun-13-2022. Fiddling with updated UI to provide more info for the entire process but overview for dao controlled funds goes something like this.

Eventually creating its own feedback loop of value. 


Wu Wei Distribution and why MVT.
No ICO has been held, and no funds have been raised. To ensure a wide range of early participants, only one account per person was allowed to sign up for the initial free airdrop distribution on Bitcointalk — alt accounts and robots were effectively removed. After the final audit of thousands of applicants, 557 initial early adopters were accepted and are set in stone on the Genesis Participant List. In order to distribute MVT in a fair and beneficial manner, every participant’s contributions were rewarded proportionally. There are currently 852 addresses holding MVT.




Leave It Better
The Movement DAO has always considered ideas like sovereignty and equality of opportunity paramount to a free and independent society. We believe that by creating green public spaces, local forested areas, and co-op-style farms, we can help support local economies and communities while also making a difference to the environment. This is the mission of Greenpoint Land Reserves. Leave it better than it was.

However, protecting the original vision of Ethereum for so long can take its toll on me so I hope with this grant I can be more incentivized to talk about the original Ethereum more and more. We want to keep things classic in the Twitter space.

2982,safechain,"Safechain is a decentralised, non-custodial safe/wallet to store your multiple wallets' private keys and sensitive information on a blockchain without any worry of misplacing/forgetting private keys. Be it the password of Netflix or the private key of your 1m$ wallet, Safechain has got you covered.

An average crypto trader manages anywhere between 5 to 50 wallets spread across multiple blockchains.
Have you ever wondered how these investors store the private keys of these wallets? Well, the answers are not that great. These are stored either on a centralized platform like Google sheets, emails, text messenger or safely secured on a piece of white paper. Now imagine one of the HODL tokens in your wallet appreciates in value after a few years and you lost track of private keys?
Sounds scary right? 
To address this problem, we want to bring an on-chain solution to store all your private keys and sensitive information. Each of the private keys will generate hybrid public addresses which will be stored on the blockchain in a safe and highly encrypted manner. So all you need to do is store the private key of 1 non-custodial wallet instead of 50+ wallets.

What is SafeChain
Safechain protocol is trying to solve the above problem statement by using industry-proven cryptography methods to store data in a safe, secure, trustless, encrypted manner.

Story of SafeChain
It's the story of 2 developers foraying into the web3 space after a long experience working with web2 technologies. Soon after being into crypto trading for few months, we realized the pain points of managing wallets and their private keys. Always being passionate and fascinated about web3 technologies, we decided to solve this particular problem for the community. 

Roadmap
1. Create chrome extension (like Metamask)
2. Provide support to store wallet private keys of multiple blockchains (ETH, MATIC, BSC, SOLANA, Polkadot, Cardano etc)
3. Provide support for other sensitive information like account passwords, secret data, etc
4. Launch governance token and hand it over to the community.


We are applying for a GitCoin Grant to make this mission a success. Do support us in bringing it to market.

3435,what-the-hell-is-blockchain-educational-project,"Hello! I’m Yinka.  

A little about me and how I started “What the Hell is Blockchain” on Clubhouse.

I was introduced to crypto in 2016 but didn’t latch on till I found out about blockchain.  It was then that I started to envision the many possible solutions the technology can foster.  Upon falling in love with the technology I learned to appreciate the many different use cases like crypto, NFT, DeFi, DAO, and more.

Over the years the technology itself was used synonymously with crypto and many did not understand the usefulness.  I started creating educational materials, blogs, articles, videos on the technology and how it can improve our future.  

Since then I have gone on to create projects, and more educational programs to help improve the adoption of the technology.  However I still found that many newcomers are introduced via media hype which can often stem from influencers, whales and even market movement. However, with the sudden interest in Cypto creates a community of FOMOs and not a community of adapters.

Since Clubhouse has been a source for everything Crypto, I looked around seeking to find rooms dedicated to just the technology.  Not many rooms showed up on search results.  

So, I created “What the Hell is Blockchain?” as a weekly educational room to educate the community. The room has grown to a community led educational session that moderators from various sections of the community help facilitate. The club has rapidly increased in size (currently over 600 members)  since its creation in late May, with simple word of mouth.  We even have a second room on Fridays - a lunch hour session to answer additional questions that the community or newcomers may have.  

To me the most important tool in creating mass adoption is by educating the community on the technology.  Newcomers will benefit from the fact that this space is much more than just Crypto but the possibility that blockchain can create.  We need people to understand decentralization and self sovereignty especially since there are indications that centralized platforms and processes are being created by various entities.  It is important for the community to stay vigilant about the perseverance of this space so we can truly realize our desired future. 

This will be my first Gitcoin round for this initiative.  

I'd like to use funds from Round 11 for:
Creating additional rooms to educate the community about the technology
Providing incentives for the moderators
Hiring a digital marketer to create impactful social media advertising to bring more members
Creating structured sessions that will focus on NFT, DeFi and DAO
Creating educational sessions on yield farming, trading bots
Building a blockchain educational podcast 
Hiring assistance to help with podcast management  

If not for the community nothing will be done, so thank you for your support on this Gitcoin Round.

Inspired by Ric's PadawanDAO (funding people for their entry into ethereum), i'd propose VitaDAO starting a small experiment to do the same doing small grants to early stage people entering longevity.

We will kickstart this program through this gitcoin grant, and make a VitaDAO proposal to provide some initial donation, as well as individual donors.

UPDATE: We funded over 21 people, from $500 to $3k, working on longevity, incl lab interns at @ George Church Lab + Buck Institute. 

—

VitaDAO Student Grants plans to do small grants of ~$1-3k for students or longevity enthusiasts who are eager to get deeply involved into longevity research with no strings attached.

For example to fund them for doing research, attending a longevity conference, or taking a workshop such as On Deck Longevity Fellowship. 

Applications should be quick and unbiased:
- sharing a link about oneself (could be website, twitter or anything)
- how one would use the funds

This model is inspired by PadawanDAO, which funded early stage people for their first ethereum conference and really impressed us.

Evaluators would consist of PadawanDAO students who are excited to help with this effort, as well as people from VitaDAOs longevity working group and other volunteers who can introduce and apply in our channel.

The biggest barriers faced while learning about web3 was identified as a lack of structured learning paths

3571,zouzoukwa-promoting-african-cultures-through-emoj,"UPDATE: I'm currently minting the 365 emojis on Foundation, you can now support Zouzoukwa by buying an NFT! (:
—

Zouzoukwa is a project at the intersection of art, design, culture and technology I started because I was tired of always seeing Africa portrayed as a land where there is only war, hunger and poverty. Since I wanted to share another side of the story, I created every day of 2018 a new emoji to celebrate the diversity and wealth of African cultures. I also released an app to make the emojis usable as stickers on WhatsApp.
The project attracted the attention of international press (The Guardian, The New York Times, CNN, BBC, El País, Le Monde), a community of 25k people on Instagram & Facebook and the app currently has more than 100k downloads on Play Store.

The need to go further
After releasing the app, I realized that most of the emojis were only about West Africa, I was relying on the internet to find cultural elements to represent and I was the one in charge of representing cultures I don’t belong to. Above all, I realized I was building a community project alone, and I couldn’t even find ways to incentivize others to join me on that adventure.

I felt stuck for 3 years, because I couldn't find a way to ethically expand the project. I didn't want to monetize the community through advertising, I didn't want to include more branded/sponsored emojis to the app. But discovering web3 in 2021 created a sparkle of hope. After exploring this new world, I realized that Zouzoukwa could become a cultural public good, collaboratively created by a tokenized community: Zouzoukwa DAO.

Zouzoukwa DAO
By creating a DAO, I can turn the single-player emoji adventure to a multiplayer one, using NFTs and a token to reward the participants. People from all parts of Africa could suggest the emojis they want to use, submit the cultural elements they want to see represented and at the same time discover web3. 
We could create a collaborative platform where the emojis would be displayed with articles to explain their significance and allow everybody to learn about them. We can release all the emojis artworks under a Creative Commons License as soon as their NFTs are bought to allow their use for educational and even commercial purposes. We can use the treasury funds to support artists, creators and contribute to social initiatives on the continent.
We can collectively create the Africa we want to see, one emoji at a time.

Supporting the project can help me work on Zouzoukwa full-time, turn the vision into reality and create the foundations of the Zouzoukwa ecosystem.

Thank you for your contributions :)

It makes OTC deals a breeze, it introduces a privacy preserving method for buying and selling Grin, and it improves fungibility and privacy of tokens and assets on the Ethereum network.

This is an open source project led by myself @jaspervdm, co-founder of vault713, a team that's behind the grinbox transaction protocol and the popular wallet713 open source project. I'm the creator of the first atomic swaps for [Grin <-> ETH](https://medium.com/grinswap/first-grin-atomic-swap-a16b4cc19196) and [Grin <-> BTC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLvgCPbagiHgqYdVUj-ylqhsXOifWrExiq&v=sT3vNycMxw4).

The MVP will be lightweight and minimal - functional for a technical person, but not polished, think command line interface. We'll start with implementing basic swap functionality between Grin and ETH and then expand this to work with ERC-20 tokens in general.

2330,kingsilver-the-decentralised-hedge-fund-stablecoi,"Envisage a world in which every person with internet access can connect to a highly efficient, highly competitive, global decentralised financial marketplace. Where rich and poor have equal access to financial services, and equal opportunity to contribute, work, invest and build platform agnostic reputations.

Speculative token investing has been the primary driving force behind cryptocurrency's growing market cap, but the huge volatility of the crypto asset market has also resulted in a lot of financially uneducated people losing a lot of money, which is why regulators all over the world have been stepping in to try to prevent new tokens being sold to un-accredited investors.

The problem however is that Hedge Funds, Venture Capital Funds, Mutual Funds, who hire the very best financial analysts and traders to manage investor's capital, typically only allow accredited investors to invest, which keeps mainstreet investors locked out.

So the rich have more opportunity by virtue of their wealth, than the poor. This disparity of opportunity is one of the problem decentralised tokens promise to solve, but even if mainstreet investors have equal access to cryptocurrency tokens, that still does not necessarily change the education and experience disparity, which is where the real financial opportunity disparity originates.

My name is Andy Moore, I am an entrepreneur that bootstrapped a men's self-development coaching company in 2010, grew it to annual revenues of $500k, and sold it in 2016. In 2017 I started working on a stablecoin concept called Kingsilver which was to be a cryptocurrency backed by real precious metals… but the project soon evolved into a much grander digital nation DAO project called Themisia, for which Kingsilver was to be the currency.

The core concept behind Themisia was a 'Truth Economy' where 'Truth Assets'—NFT facts that had been proven to be true with evidence (other truth assets)—could be freely created, rented, and sold. While this concept is exciting with huge potential, in mid 2020 I decided to put that huge vision on hold and instead refocus on a much simpler problem with a much clearer value proposition—I returned to the original Kingsilver stablecoin.

Merely backing Kingsilver with precious metals however wasn't really solving a big enough problem, and so I started working on a concept for a decentralised stablecoin where the community of contributors had full control over what crypto assets would back it.

After months of concept design, I am ready to start developing Kingsilver: the fully decentralised stablecoin backed by a redeemable pool of crypto assets that is managed by a community of analysts all competing with each other for a large share of control.

The mechanics behind stablecoin will not rely on algorithms, complex smart contracts or AI, but instead, simple human greed. All decision making will be performed by human roles operating within a game-theory environment engineered to produce single outcomes that all work together to perpetuate Kingsilver into future with a pool of crypto assets engineered to beat the market and appreciate in value. I can't reveal the secret sauce here, but it involves separate roles of analysts, fund managers, nominators, arbitrageurs, un unlimited number of logarithmic bonding curve liquidity pools, and a secondary marketplace of tokens that represent the value of manager's niche funds.

Kingsilver will allow anyone, rich or poor, to benefit from the talent of the world's best financial analysts. And once Kingsilver has demonstrated its superiority as a store of value and safe investment vehicle, I envisage it becoming the central axis atop which a  DAO can be formed, where the votes, rights and reputations of participants have real value and the protection of which will be needed.

I need help with this vision however—although I have been learning Solidity, I am not a developer by trade, so there is a long road ahead of me. I am obsessed though, and this is all I work on every day. If you think this sounds like a cool project that you would like to see in the world, I would be incredibly grateful for any support, whether that is in the form of grant donations, or connections, mentors, or simply words of encouragement.

In 2018, BAD - The Blockchain Art Directory, a partly edited, partly community-fed web directory of past, present and future crypto projects, was born. A free-to-use OG service, BAD provided the first on-boarding and educational resources on dApps and Web3 tools, welcoming newcomers, artists, collectors, and journalists to autonomously navigate the NFT and blockchain space. Back then, BAD was instrumental to the understanding and adoption of blockchain art, crypto-collectibles and blockchain technology.

Today, the pace within which the NFT space is developing is tremendous, as is the demand for reliable education around NFTs and blockchain technology. In response to this global boom, BAD - The Blockchain Art Directory -  relaunches as BAD 2.0. Having completely revised content, resources and a new look by award-winning designers Human Resources and DENKEN, BAD 2.0 provides education resources and documents projects which are groundbreaking to the blockchain art and crypto collectibles space.

BAD 2.0 is operated by crypto art advisor & curator Fanny Lakoubay, crypto art collector/BAD 1.0 founder Judith Seipold and crypto art and content manager Harry Martin. In the future, BAD 2.0 will also be backed by an OG bureau of crypto-art players (artists, curators and all around awesome people).


Our Gitcoin Grant:

Thanks to your overwhelming support over the last few funding rounds, the BAD 2.0 site is currently undergoing a massive redesign by Human Resources and DENKEN. We have invested your funds with this excellent design duo, choosing them for their prizes (including this year’s Scottish Design Award) and projects such as GRAS and SUPERICO.

Powered by Tezos, this programme educates cultural institutions about Web3, NFTs and the blockchain, allowing them to build projects for the arts and culture from scratch through immersive teaching, tutorship, and prototyping. BAD has been key in presenting WAC Weekly as part of this series: an online conversation where knowledge on the latest relevant topics concerning Web3 is exchanged with art world professionals.

These new designs and Web3 ventures will allow us to set a solid basis to accomplish our plans outlined below.👇


Where We Are Going:

With your support, we hope to accomplish the following:

1. With the launch of our re-designed BAD 2.0 website, we will start to launch revisited contents, covering a set of information and educational resources for newcomers, artists, collectors, journalists and researchers with a focus on onboarding and deep dives on projects, as well as the reviving of the original art directory as a snapshot of the early blockchain art history (projects from the very beginning of blockchains to the end of 2018).

2. After the successful implementation of the new website, we will start to curate new entries into the BAD 2.0 database by an OG bureau of BAD curators & ambassadors, who will regularly vote on new entries into the database and the necessary educational resources to add.

3. As a preliminary final step, we aim to decentralize the BAD 2.0 directory further to achieve a fully decentralized, community-driven resource, experimenting with governance and web3 tools.

To see live progress made on BAD 2.0’s site build, please visit www.badog.xyz and consult our Figma file. We thank the whole crypto-art community for your incredible donations so far (and for being so awesome)!

3930,open-senolytics,"TL;DR Senolytics are a powerful new class of longevity therapeutic. They selectively kill disease-causing senescent cells that accumulate in our bodies as we age. In this project we will test a class of drugs we identified called cationic amphipathic drugs (CADs) that we’ve shown in preliminary studies to have powerful senolytic activity. Based on the drugs’ chemistry we propose this class acts like an intracellular soap to ‘clean out’ these ‘old’ senescent cells from the body. Because many of the drugs we’re testing are already in use in humans and are inexpensive, and we will make our results publicly available, our goal is to accelerate the longevity field by providing immediately useful therapies.

What are Senolytics? And how do they relate to longevity? 

Aging is the #1 risk factor for many common diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s, etc. Meaning, the older one is the more likely one is to have one of these conditions. There are several molecular explanations for this increased risk, but senescent cells that accumulate as we age are emerging as a key contributor. 

Senescence refers to cells that are no longer dividing. Senescent cells are particularly important in the context of stem cells. Over our lifespans our stem cells throughout our body need to continually proliferate in order to replace damaged cells to replenish our tissues. As we age, damaged cells outpace healthy cells and the resulting increase in senescent cells results in decreased function. Moreover, senescent cells secrete pro-inflammatory and other destructive signals that can add insult to injury.  



Eliminating senescent cells – akin to taking out our body’s trash – is now well-established as effective in a variety of aging-related disease models. A first therapeutically tractable approach to eliminate senescent cells was discovered by James Kirkland and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic in 2015. The term ‘senolytics’ was coined to describe the drugs they identified that ‘lysed’ or killed senescent cells. They prototype senolytic they discovered, dasatinib, was interesting because it had previously been used as a cancer therapeutic. Since then, researchers have identified others including navitoclax.  

Despite this progress, the field has been limited in its search for senolytics because they don’t fit in the predominant paradigm of drug development. In drug development one typically needs a protein to target a drug against. In this paradigm researchers design a drug to fit in a molecular ‘pocket’ in a protein in a lock-and-key-like mechanism where the drug binding to the pocket either inhibits or activates the protein. With senolytics, however, the drug target is a cell and not a protein. The field therefore has been bottlenecked by not knowing what an effective senolytic should ‘look’ like. Senolytic identifying assays still involve the time and labor-intensive screening experiments Kirkland et al first developed. To date, only a few reproducibly effective senolytics have been developed.  

More importantly, fewer yet are in the hands of researchers around the world. Because of the exploding interest in senolytics numerous companies rushed to the space. Perhaps most well know is the Jeff Bezos-backed Unity Biotechnology. Unfortunately, initial senolytic clinical trials haven’t been successful. This is a problem for the field because with companies one can’t know what drugs are being developed so the field doesn’t benefit from their insights and failures. This slows progress. 

The field is need of concerted public efforts for identifying senolytics. This is why we started Open Senolytics. 

Backstory on Open Senolytics 

The work that led to our approach of identifying was a classic example of following the science. During the COVID pandemic we set out to understand what human genes might be commonly implicated in host responses across pathogens. Such a gene set could be a starting point as a target for a broad-spectrum prophylactic as well as be informative in the event of future pandemics. We performed meta-analyses of 15 genome-wide screens and 31 transcriptomic profiles involving diverse pathogens including viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Interestingly, the clear unifying signature from this analysis were factors related to sphingolipids and senescence. 

We next sought to identify drugs that might target similar gene sets to those we identified with pathogens. Such drugs might represent a therapeutic for multiple pathogens. We performed analogous unbiased experiments and discovered drugs with cationic amphiphilic chemical properties (CADs) had a striking gene overlap (75%) to those we found for pathogens in also centering on sphingolipids and senescence. One notable example CAD we found is fluvoxamine, which is showing promise in multiple COVID-19 trials. 

That we found CADs to specifically relate to both pathogens and senescence was interesting in light of senolytics. Senolytics selectively kill pathogenic senescent cells compared with healthy proliferating cells, but it is unclear what their molecular target is that provides this selectivity. Without this rationale, it has been hard to make progress in identifying new senolytics. In this proposal, we hypothesize drugs that possess cationic amphiphilic properties chemically resemble sphingolipids and are a defining class of senolytics. We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aim: 

Specific Aim 1: Establish CADs senolytic capabilities across senescence-inducing insults and cell types 

Many insults can induce cell senescence, yet their effects can vary by cell type. The same is true for senolytics. 

Objective 1: Determine the efficacy of CADs as senolytics in the context of various senescence-inducing insults. In addition to pathogens, we will use commonly used senescence-inducers such as irradiation to determine to what extent each CAD’s senolytic activity is agnostic to the source of the induction or whether different CADs have different inducer specificities.

Objective 2: Determine the efficacy of CADs as senolytics in various cell types. To maintain feasibility in this objective, we will focus on pathogens as our senescence-inducing insults. 

We have preliminary evidence this aim should succeed as expected. We identified several CADs performing as strongly as dasatinib, which notably is also a CAD (Figure 1). Interestingly, many of the CADs we identified are psychiatric medications. This aim is an in vitro aim. Depending on the resources available we would be interested in testing our results in vivo. 



Who is the team behind Open Senolytics? 

Our team is led by Tim Peterson, Ph.D. and Sandeep Kumar, Ph.D. Dr. Peterson is an Assistant Professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis in the Departments of Medicine and Genetics. “WashU” is a perennially top five medical school in the U.S. in terms of publishing and funding. Dr. Peterson did his Ph.D. at MIT where he published multiple papers in Nature, Science, and Cell journal on one of the major aging pathways, mTOR, and the drug, rapamycin, that targets it. Dr. Peterson did his postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University where he continued his work on longevity drug mechanisms focusing on the most commonly used drugs for osteoporosis, bisphosphonates and diabetes, metformin. Dr. Kumar similarly has a deep background in aging research most notably performing several seminal lifespan studies in worms. 

Dr. Morten Scheibye-Knudsen at the University of Copenhagen will be assisting us with his AI-driven senescent cell detection algorithms (see below). These algorithms are helpful because they allow us much greater throughput in our experiments. Thus, we can test many more CADs.

3324,ipfspace,"IPFSpace aims to build Decentralized DataSharing Infrastructure. 
IPFSpace‘s mission: “To store the world's data and share it to the world.
IPFSpace's deck link: https://hub.textile.io/ipfs/bafybeicgdjsy77vg3ilg5c5he2kxjeogqx6t3oceockm5zdb4hinvbthyy

Problems:
Identity information is controlled by the service platform
Centralized storage of data, controlled by centralized service providers, very insecure
The data storage platform is too differentiated, and the life cycle may be short (burning money to death)
The data storage platform charges fees by controlling download speed and other unreasonable behaviors
The resource link of the data is easy to expire and lose, resulting in the data cannot be retrieved
Data cannot be shared effectively (data is controlled centrally and cannot be shared)
Duplicate data and excessive junk data make data acquisition difficult
Content creators cannot transfer data to other platforms (data will be lost if the platform account is cancelled)
Data sharing and reward economy are difficult to combine
Solution:
All data are built on the next protocols that power the web3 (IPFS,Filecoin,Textile,NFT.storage,Web3.storage)
Decentralized registration brought by blockchain
Decentralized Sharing based on Token Economy System
Decentralized Searching based on data's metadata （also rewards on Token Economy System）
Data generates NFT and on-chain transaction

Our core is to store and share humanity's data . IPFS-based content addressing will be an index of data, and the metadata of data will be a secondary index of data. Everyone can obtain the data they want and share their existing data and obtain token economic rewards through sharing behaviors, and the data can be stored safely and stably for a long time. The humanity's data will have its own economic reward model. Anyone can get benefits from sharing,data interaction and can also act as a data verifier to determine the quality of the data to obtain benefits, and at the same time to maintain the data high quality.

Playfully, Akashick invites you to find creative ways to express, embed and communicate on a single chain while lifting the verse forever.

 “To this amazing core community, I would be really grateful if you go and send a message on the platform address(how to in demo video below). You do not need to send any eth to send a message, you can also use rinkeby-testnet version if you do not wish to spend even the transaction fee. I aim to put this out there to communities outside blockchain as well in forms of public art installation to spread awareness of decentralization and as a tool to use, but that doesn’t make an impact unless there’s some initial traction from the core.
   What would be your immutable message to the world?”

-------
 
Version 0.1 DEMO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUi6O7U30R4

-------

>>> Initial v0.01 presentation pitch: https://youtu.be/WizENIHx4A8

Art plays important roles on revolutions, expression, spreading the awareness and reforming thoughts and ways. Akashick(v1) is art installation or a platform for immutable message/data on a single thread/chain.
 
 -------

 Future Direction: 
 how the funds will be used:
 
Short Term:

	Streamlined Interface for sending message.
	Currently as you can see from demo video, sending the message process is not very grandma friendly, one needs to convert text to hex on their own and take care of certain things in the process. The first goal would be creating a grandma friendly interface for this where you just type message and hit send. There are two versions here: MainNet version(ability to connect to metamask directly to send message) . Rinkeby Version: Here, I plan to link the wallet in backend so people do not even need to deal with wallets and all, this enables people unfamiliar to blockchain space, directly try out the space and send messages. 

	Versions : mobile compatibility / embedded version, message only version, view only art version, mixed, public installation version.

	Onchain Embedding (Images, Pdfs, Files etc)
	Grandma friendly interface to embed immutable pictures, files and more. (experimentation with directly on chain or ipfs/ filecoin).
 
Mid-term:
 
	Graphics!!!
	 Wrapping the initial space with appealing graphics: Interactive shaders, organic-cyberpunk visuals(concept dev), HDRP + Optimizations for web.
 
	Expos, Public Installations 
	Its about spreading the awareness! + Website, Marketing, Academic Research: on community interaction/platform/ outcomes.
	Bug fixes, extra language font support, feedback mods and fixes.

 
 There is no tokenomics involved and is purely an artform and a platform directly on eth to spread the awareness, from a pure space of passion and love for blockchain, decentralization, cryptosphere, equality and freedom of speech. 
 
 
 
Possible Long Term: 
I have some further ideas with gamification of the space, such as an interactive multiplayer platform inside the verse(diamond-eth logo), - mini games or virtual festivals or community art gallery etc. There are also some thoughts around crosschain NFT’s or cross platform transitions and collaboration with other forms of blockchain art and games. And some great mechanics, physics systems and ideas with the verse which co-relates with the outside message blocks(note, as you may see in pitch video, when one sends a message, a block spawns, which lifts the verse). Though more on this after initial mid-term goals 😊 , If it kicks off really well, I have some amazing game dev peers to bring onboard and ofcourse the great online global community.

103,tradescope-investigating-market-manipulation,"Equity, forex and cryptocurrency markets around the world accommodate the exchange of assets worth Billions of dollars between millions of investors and traders. While the former two are strictly controlled through numerous regulatory directives, cryptocurrency markets remain mostly unregulated. This raises several questions about the fairness and transparency of those markets, as they potentially expose investors to toxic flows and predatory traders. To mitigate these risks, several cryptocurrency exchanges take steps to maintain a healthy trading environment through self-regulation. Despite these efforts, market manipulation and abuse remain open problems in cryptocurrency exchanges.
 
TradeScope will study both misleading cryptocurrency trading practices, and market manipulation that exploits technical details and glitches in the operation of the exchanges. Such techniques are used by predatory traders with deep knowledge of the cryptocurrency market and the exchange’s microstructure to gain an unfair advantage over the other market participants.
 
Our goal is to shed light on these, often poorly understood, predatory techniques and propose novel mitigation and detection methods. For this purpose, TradeScope will conduct a large-scale study on manipulation in cryptocurrency exchanges. This will enable us to better examine the technical underpinnings of common fairness problems in cryptocurrency exchanges and propose market design improvements that effectively thwart manipulation without affecting price discovery.

Lately, more people have been starting to make use of this portfolio tracker and I thought I would put this grant together in case it is able to incentivise me to spend more time working on Cryptocape outside of my day job.

Each time the page refreshes, data is built up using a combination of the Etherscan, CoinGecko, Ethplorer & Cryptocompare APIs. Once the loading bar passes the halfway point, all pricing will show according to CoinGecko. Before the halfway point is reached, it will be using Cryptocompare data (loads faster than CoinGecko's data, but CoinGecko tends to be more accurate than any other data source I have tried).

On mobile, the website can be saved to the device's home screen, in which case it will open in the fashion of a conventional mobile application.

InstCrypt provides Defi Gasless wallet which is supported by meta transaction. 
If you want to transfer crypto token to any ethereum address you need gas to perform a transaction. InstCrypt is providing gasless or meta-transaction wallet which is built on top of Biconomy-Mexa SDK. So, our simple aims to crypto should be use like fiat currency without requiring user to purchase gas for that(#GoGasLess).

InstCrypt Come from Hackathon.
We started this project in Money-legos Defi hackathon-April, 2020 by ETHIndia. And Instcrypt secured the bounties for that too. 
Here you can see tweet from EthIndia community for InstCrypt: https://twitter.com/ETHIndiaco/status/1260217276378173441

What After Hackathon?
After Hackathon, We integrate Gasless Uniswap-V2 and Uniswap-V2 oracles to set up a trustless automated crypto trading platform without requiring the user to pass minimum return value for safety on top of Biconomy-mexa SDK to support Meta-transaction and Gasless.
Other Features with Meta-Transaction or Gasless support
Integrate Kyber Swap .
Integrate Uniswap-V2 to enable automate trade.
Platform Saves transaction history of all wallet and trading transactions at and provide history one stop on platform.
	So now InstCrypt provide gasless defi wallet and Crypto trading platform using uniswap and kyber.

Why Gitcoin Grant?

I am using this Gitcoin grant to attempt to partially fund the development of the project. Funding opensource work is not easy and I want to try what Gitcoin can do towards alleviating that problem. Especially since we currently have a ton of feature to do and requests and we are 2 people working on it without funding. Proper funding would change that and allow us to devote more time and perhaps also get additional help.

Why should you contribute?

To help us keep developing an opensource tool that supports Gasless transactions.
We plan to integrate with most of the major DeFi platforms available today in the network with the feature Gasless and meta-transaction.
		That is:
Compound lending and borrowing
Support for Aave lending and borrowing
Support uniswap exchange
... and more (if you have any suggestions please contact us in discord/telegram/twitter -- links below)
Additionally, We are working towards integrate Zero Knowledge proof to maintain the privacy of transactions done by Wallet user and Traders.
If you like what we are doing and want to help us achieve our mission you can donate as much you want via this Grant. Even 1 DAI counts, if it's happening during the CLR round thanks to the fund matching mechanism.
All funds we get from this grant will go towards development of ethereum features for InstCrypt. Either those outlined above or other that you request of us.

858,ethereum-for-environmental-intelligence,"Embedding our global economic system into the environment is crucial for humankind's well-being 🌿✨

Environmental intelligence (EI) is a field that deals with the aggregation and transformation of data inputs into meaningful signals and models about a particular bioregion or ecological system. It informs and steers decision-makers who deal with environmental policy and management. It is closely related to the field of ecological engineering, which requires EI feedback mechanisms to “predict, design, construct or restore, and manage ecosystems that integrate human society with its natural environment for the benefit of both."" 

With the accelerating deterioration of the biosphere, EI is fast becoming a relevant cross-cutting field with many actors aiming to link the entire EI value chain from embedded sensor network to socioeconomic policy-making. As Ethereum becomes more scalable due to its upcoming Phase 2 launch and current Layer 2 technologies, it’s now becoming crucial to begin preliminary EI research from a web3 industry lens. We must better understand, aggregate, and evaluate the full range of Ethereum-native in-situ and remote sensing technologies, and begin speculating on the trustless design and rollout of regenerative finance solutions. 

Curve Labs is working at two scales simultaneously in the domain of environmental intelligence:

1️⃣ At the micro-level, we are looking to embed EI into complementary currency systems, creating and testing new regenerative finance models that derive value through local protection and responsible care of the biosphere. I discuss this at length in my blog post, “Cryptospheric Ecotechnics.” 

2️⃣ At the macro-level, through the CO2ken project, we are figuring out the most efficient way to structure a carbon-reward regenerative currency that incentivizes carbon reduction at a global scale. These efforts follow Chen et. als. proposed “Risk Cost of Carbon.”


Adaptive governance map of Stockholm, Sweden. Approaching social-ecological systems from the Ethereum lens means imagining DAO governance architecture that can respond to environmental-cyberphysical feedback mechanisms, directing economic interventions and institutional policies in support of a given bioregion.

Through this grant, Curve Labs seeks to answer the following research questions:

🐸 Who are the industry players at the different layers of the blockchain ‘environmental intelligence stack,’ and which use cases are they most interested in? That is, who is actively pursuing solutions in cyber-physical blockchain systems, who is pursuing adaptive governance and regenerative finance solutions, and which actors are interested in financing further research and/or funding pilot experiments?

🦋 What is the minimum viable embedded sensor network or EI protocol we can use to monitor and valuate the health of a forest or bioregion as a complementary currency? Which system inputs offer the most leverage for translating economic interventions into meaningful ecological state change?

🍃 Finally, we believe now is the time to begin to build a network of EI-blockchain experts and enthusiasts, and will steer/cultivate this discourse within the broader Token Engineering community.

Curve Labs is a team of design and development interventionists architecting distributed solutions for the future economy. We tackle systemic challenges of the Anthropocene by creating, combining, and integrating modular open-source technologies to form organizations more than the sum of their parts ➰

DAO consultancy
In order to improve DAO onboarding for contributors in the ecosystem, we are supporting DAOs and organizations in the creation of educational material for the skills and roles they employ. 
This consists of a series of workshops to help DAOs understand their roles, assign payments and create a documentation of the roles.
A few examples of a documentation:
docs.deepwork.studio
https://deep-work.gitbook.io/prime-rating/
https://deep-work.gitbook.io/tech-support-guild/
This gives new contributors an understanding of the required work before they get involved and the internal DAO team gains clarity over the exact requirements when screening and recruiting new contributors. 

Application and Talent Network
In parallel to consulting DAOs and creating roles, we are developing an application that uses that data to decentralize hiring practices for web3-native organizations. The app will help contributors discover projects, find the right person to get in touch with, start working on projects and over time compile a verified history of work. 
You can see the Figma prototype here.

Deep Skills Protocol
Solving these issues will help an individual organization vet its talent and scale more organically. 
In order to provide value to the entire ecosystem, we are working on collecting more data points and designing an incentive network for reputation data.

You can read more and play with a demo of the protocol here.

Funding
In this round we are looking for funding to progress with the MVP based on the prototype. All funds will be used pay our team of engineers to continue building out the tool and make it accessible for organizations at any stage.

Introduction
These docs are a comprehensive guide to the Compound protocol, based on the Compound Whitepaper (Feb 2019). The protocol codebase is hosted on Github, and maintained by the community.
Please join the #development room in the Compound community Discord server; our team, and members of the community, look forward to helping you build an application on top of Compound. Your questions help us improve, so please don't hesitate to ask if you can't find what you are looking for here.

Protocol Math
The Compound protocol contracts use a system of exponential math, Exponential.sol, in order to represent fractional quantities with sufficient precision.
Most numbers are represented as a mantissa, an unsigned integer scaled by 1 * 10 ^ 18, in order to perform basic math at a high level of precision.
cToken and Underlying Decimals
Prices and exchange rates are scaled by the decimals unique to each asset; cTokens are ERC-20 tokens with 8 decimals, while their underlying tokens vary, and have a public member named decimals.

The Compound Protocol is a suite of Ethereum smart contracts that enable software developers to interface with cryptocurrency money markets. In order to supply or borrow assets from the protocol, you need to write to the Ethereum blockchain.
Ethereum is a public network of decentralized nodes that process transactions and append them to an ever-growing ledger, which is known as the blockchain. Developers can write software called smart contracts that are hosted on the Ethereum network. Anyone with access to Ethereum can invoke write and read operations to and from the blockchain.
In order to create a program for Ethereum and interact with Compound’s smart contracts, you need to have an access point to the network, some knowledge of smart contract architecture, and also some knowledge of JSON RPC.
Ethereum Development Key Concepts
Setting up your dev environment for Ethereum development takes just a few minutes. It’s important to have a basic understanding of a few general concepts before we start writing code.
Solidity - The most popular programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum.
Web3.js - A JavaScript library for web browsers and Node.js that enables developers to elegantly read and write to the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts written in Solidity can be executed using JSON RPC from Web3.js.
Infura.io - A company that provides an API for simple Ethereum network access through HTTP and WebSockets. To access the network without a service like Infura’s API, you must host your own Ethereum network node.
Ethereum Networks - The Ethereum Main Network (a.k.a Homestead) is considered to be the production environment. This is where real Ether (ETH) can be exchanged, burned, and mined. Also, there are popular public test networks: Ropsten, Göerli, Kovan, and Rinkeby. All of these networks can be accessed via Infura’s API.
Cloudflare’s Ethereum Gateway - Cloudflare, a popular DNS and general web-infrastructure company provides a free API for accessing the Ethereum Main Net. Unlike Infura, Cloudflare’s gateway can be used without an account or API. The network can be interfaced with at https://cloudflare-eth.com. However, you can interface with only Homestead; not Ropsten, Göerli, Kovan, or Rinkeby.
Truffle - A company that creates Ethereum development tools like Truffle, Ganache, and Drizzle. In this guide, we’ll be installing Ganache CLI so we can run our Solidity and Web3.js code locally during development.
Ganache CLI - A command line interface for running a locally hosted instance of Ethereum. We can start up a blank Ethereum blockchain, or a fork of a public network’s blockchain on your local machine.
Solc - The Solidity compiler. This turns our human-readable Solidity code into Ethereum bytecode, which Ethereum network nodes understand how to execute.
MetaMask - A web browser extension that facilitates invocation of Ethereum smart contracts from a web page. MetaMask uses Web3.js under the hood. It is a tool for end users to use ETH, Ethereum based cryptocurrency tokens, and keep track of their Ethereum wallets when using decentralized, Web3 applications (a.k.a. DApps).
Installing MetaMask
MetaMask is a web browser extension that can be installed on Google Chrome, FireFox, Opera, or Brave. End users can use the extension to interface with smart contracts.
For example, when you visit https://app.compound.finance/, you can use MetaMask to supply your cryptocurrency assets to the Compound Protocol. The act of supplying assets on that website uses Web3.js and JSON RPC under the hood.
Those remote procedure calls are invoking Compound’s smart contract functions, like mint, to accept your assets in exchange for cTokens.
You can set the network on MetaMask to point to any of the public networks, your own network, and even your localhost network. As you’re developing your DApp’s front-end web page, you can also test the back-end of the DApp locally if you are running Ganache CLI. This makes MetaMask a solid testing and development tool in addition to being an end user product.


The MetaMask browser extension automatically imports the Web3 object as global JavaScript variable on every webpage the user visits. It uses the HTTP provider in which is selected in the pictured drop down menu(more on providers later).
Installing the Solidity Compiler (solc)
Before you deploy a smart contract to an Ethereum network (or your localhost), you must first compile it to bytecode. This turns your program into machine-readable opcodes that Ethereum nodes understand how to execute.
In addition to bytecode, the Solidity compiler also produces an ABI (application binary interface). This is a JSON object that maps to your bytecode. Web3.js (and other frameworks) can do JSON RPC using the ABI, and the address of your smart contract. Think of the ABI as the bridge between Web2 and Web3.
Installing solc can be done using Homebrew on Mac or apt-get and the like on Linux distributions. Windows users need to build from source. Solidity compiler installation instructions for any OS can be found in the Solidity documentation.
Be sure to install the version of solc that corresponds to the pragma line in your smart contract code. The Solidity code we will write later uses version 5.
Once you have installed the Solidity compiler, you can use it on the command line to compile a Solidity file. If compilation succeeds, you’ll get bytecode and a JSON ABI.

1375,usm-a-minimalist-stablecoin-nearing-launch,"USM is a project to build the ""simplest possible decentralized stablecoin"".  The system consists of two tokens, USM (the stablecoin, pegged to $1) and FUM (""minimalist funding-coin"", which fluctuates in price), backed by a pool of ETH.  Four operations create/redeem the tokens for ETH at the current ETH/USD market price:

mint(): user gives ETH, gets back USM
burn(): give USM, get ETH
fund(): give ETH, get FUM
defund(): give FUM, get ETH

You can read more about the design in the original July Medium post, our August follow-up, and our recent November update - after 3+ months of intense development USM is now feature-complete and approaching launch, probably by January 2021!  See https://github.com/usmfum/USM.

Communities are the fundamental source of our sense of strength and resilience, belonging and prosperity. The importance of communities has been made even more vividly for us over the past six months during the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of locally-based volunteers, Mutual Aid Groups (MAGs), and squads has multiplied and have been exceptional examples of willingness of individuals to contribute to and commit to the common good and welfare of one's own community.

⚛️What is FightPandemics?
FightPandemics is starting as an open source platform that connect individuals and organizations that need help with those that can provide it at the local and global level in over 20 languages. Our main goal is to create tools for humans and communities to collaborate, coordinate, co-create and hopefully be more resilient to emergencies.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦Who are we?
We are a purpose driven volunteer community of builders from all over the world, with the mission of creating social infrastructure that can help us foster communities. We have had over 1500+ contributors out of 6000+ who have applied that help with the creation of our MVP. We have around 35-55 people who have an important role within the community and we call them coordinators and stewards, they are the true engine of this open source organization as they identify what are the issues to be solved and connect them with the skills offered by different volunteers. 

💸Why Gitcoin Grants?
Our team hasn't fundraised any money. We have only asked for donation of software from over 40+ organizations that believe in our mission (check the supporters), and the hours and knowledge from our volunteers. We are participating in this round because we need to pay for services when we run out of credits.

👁Who are we looking for?
FightPandemics collective is looking for problem solvers, community organizers, makers, designers, creators, artists, web3 engineers, token engineers, game developers, documenters, game theory experts, educators and anyone who is willing to contribute to the creation of a mission driven sustainable social platform/protocol #ForCommunitiesByCommunities. Apply here: https://apply.workable.com/fightpandemics/.

🔜What's next for FightPandemics?
We are currently using web2 and we are planning to ad web3 capabilities in Q in order to minimize the single points of failure that we currently have. 
🔹Create an NFT minter for the organizations within our platform.
🔹Launch on IPFS and Arweave.
🔹Migrate our centralized DBs to solutions like BigchainDB, OrbitDB or Gun.
🔹Integration Silkey.io, walletconnect, BrightID, Upala.

2445,the-word-block,"what difference can web3 bring to CONTENT? Word block aims to explore a new experience between content and individuals.

Block ID: Each piece of content carries a relationship








Bi-directional linking capability

The introduction of bi-directional links is for bridging web2 context with web 3 id-ized content. The concern is that the original and majority of the context is still on web2 pages(URLs), and the content we abstract from that context could have a parallel “identity(ID)“ enabled by web3 infrastructure.
Later, we could do things like block mapping and text computation on IPFS(probably not on IPFS, but some middle layer for semantic computing), while the context are addressable on web 2.


Treat every piece of content as an object, we could have a fresher and more interactive relationship with the content. Imagine you are building “the block web“!

This 👆thinking stems from a missing experience. For a long time, I suffered from repeatedly OCR (optical character recognition), PDF highlights, web pages (URLs) clips,…etc from separate mediums. And then to make it “in one place“, i become a tester & expert of TOOLs, i tried so many note-taking tools, plug-ins, and their corresponding plug-ins…and

You’d better not change your software, or lose the PDF or anything, otherwise things are too tough to think about🤯. Mediums never exist as ""objects"" with “us(objects)”, we are trying to organize them until realizing they are dandelion.



Simply put, can I do it once (cOpy, highlight, clip, cut, generate) and these things can follow ""me""?
So the question is, how do I operate on the content itself, and establish a relationship with it?

A product idea_((word block))

Proof of text via wallet signature.

From the beginning, whatever text you generate is under your signature.


Text generation with ease

Whenever you generate text, either note-taking or clipping content with its context, you can easily keep that in word blocks.



Easy to reference on any editor

Take mirror for example,

1. You can pull up the plugin at any time to see the previously saved blocks


2. Copy the block ID (with bidirectional links)




3. For readers, jump directly to the specific part of the web page (like scroll-to-text)


Search (semantic web)
As you see, as we accumulate a block network of text, a semantic network needs to be constructed for block search.


Thoughts for the Block Network 🕸️ :
Create a set of intermediaries (e.g., a group of people taking notes)
Store the semantic relations of blocks on a network of these intermediaries
spend up the retrieval of blocks (either yours or others' can be queried) keywords/categories/time/factors

The Burner Wallet 2 is the continuation of Austin Griffith's groundbreaking original Burner Wallet. When first revealed at ETHDenver, the Burner Wallet inspired many developers to rethink how blockchain applications are built.

The Burner Wallet 2 follows many of the original UI/UX design patterns of the Burner Wallet, but rebuilds them as a set of libraries that are stable, modular and extendable. Our goal is to make this project as developer-friendly as possible, empowering developers to build custom wallets and extend functionality by building plugins. 

The Burner Wallet 2 has already powered a number of great events:
Escape Room at ETHBerlin
Happy hour at ETHBoston
MakerDAO booth at DevCon
Stock Market after-party at ETHWaterloo
Smaller community meetups

Burner Factory
The sister-project to the Burner Wallet 2 is the Burner Factory: a web app that allows anyone to build a custom ""burner experience"" without writing a single line of code. The current site allows customizing the set of tokens and exchange pairs included in a wallet, and quickly deploying that wallet to a server. However, features will be launching soon to power the creation of new tokens, generation of paper wallets, and more!

More about the launch of the Burner Factory

The Burner Factory aims to give everybody that ""magic moment"" experiencing cryptocurrencies, whether they're from the traditional financial industry or a developing country.

Current Goals
ETHDenver
The Burner Wallet was launched by Austin Griffith at last year's ETHDenver, and we're planning an even crazier experience at this year's event. Details to come...

Global Burner community events
The Burner Factory makes it possible for anyone, anywhere to run an ETHDenver-style Burner Wallet event without writing any code. Over the next few months, we will begin working with local blockchain meetup groups to begin running these events around the world.

Developer resources
The Burner Wallet 2 is one of the easiest frameworks for building easy-to-use dapps. Over the next few months, we'll be putting together resources to help developers learn how to build plugins and customized wallets.

412,ethereum-classic-dao-defi-stack-lts-solution,"WHAT:

Ethereum Classic DAO will be organizing a development fund on EthereumClassic.com to future proof the development efforts on-top of Ethereum Classic's protocol stack.

WHERE:
EthereumClassic.com - the homepage for ETC.

WHEN:
While this funding project has been planned for many years, the participants on Ethereum Classic prefer a development style similar to Bitcoin. Ethereum Classic developers watch the Ethereum Foundation's EVM, like an experimental branch, and port over the successful updates and protocols to Ethereum Classic, the main branch in the EVM ecosystem. This approach to slower, more sound development is similar to how Bitcoin utilized sister network Litecoin to test implementation of SegWit and Lightning Network.

This development funding project was put in motion in March, 2022 with anticipation of private funding from Grayscale's Ethereum Classic Trust hitting the end of its life. This was last private source of funding and was removed in April, 2022. This project also aligned with the Ethererum Foundation's risky and experimental move to Proof-of-Stake. The result of this change is a paradigm shift resulting in an abundance of hashrate expected to secure Ethereum Classic, the main branch of the EVM ecosystem.

WHY:
Ethereum Classic is the original EVM network launched in 2015. It was abandoned by it's foundation in July, 2016 due to an event known as the ""DAO Bailout"" hardfork. Since this abandonment by the Ethereum Foundation, the Ethereum Classic network has struggled to maintain a replacement for this long term funding support. That does not mean organizations or people have not successfully supported the network to date. It just means that Ethereum Classic as it sits today does not have the funding mechanics setup to assure resources for future-proof development of the protocol. While solving this problem is a lofty goal. We believe we have identified an approach to this funding problem that will have long term lasting effect and require minimal capital to jumpstart a positive feedback funding loop.

HOW:
ETC Use Cases, Transactions, LTS Funding Pool:
We plan to use the EthereumClassic.com domain as the homepage for interacting with the most useful EVM protocols launched on Ethereum Classic. A requirement for any protocol or product referenced on EthereumClassic.com will be that a portion of their fees will be allocated to this future-proofing development fund. As an example, in the swapping product, 30 bps is collected from each swap. a portion of those 30 bps will be allocated to the development fund. This enables users to support development on Ethereum Classic by simply using the network's protocol stack. Meaning ETC and tokens deployed on the Ethereum Classic network will inherent this added value through the increased use cases developed by these protocols. Think: Lending/Borrowing markets, Liquidity Pools, Farming, Speculation Markets and such for any asset deployed on top of Ethereum Classic.

Hashrate, Fee Market, and Miner ROI:
This increase in on-chain use cases and products should increase the base level of transactions on Ethereum Classic. This will in turn fill the blocks with a constant demand for inclusion. We expect the mempool will then start to grow and congest which will stimulate the fee market mechanics on Ethereum Classic. With the formation of the fee market, we will see miner ROI calculates grow from focusing solely on the block rewards to assessing the added fees generated from this increase in usage. This will help maintain and grow the hashrate on Ethereum Classic as miners continue to turn hashrate toward ETC due to increased profitability. This also helps ease the financial effects of the 5M20 emission schedule on the mining ecosystem.

Bridges and On-Chain Liquidity:
As a stop-gap, we will work with known bridge solutions to build liquidity ramps on and off the Ethereum Classic EVM. This will increase the TVL (total Value Locked) on top of Ethereum Classic and increase the native liquidity pools for further development down the DeFi stack and other downstream products. The goal here is to build up the on-chain liquidity for Dapp Developers. We expect that we will need port over flagship assets that reside in the greater EVM ecosystem into synthetic assets on ETC like WBTC, USDT, USDC, DAI. As hashrate grows to secure the network and on-chain liquidity grows, we expect product teams to natively issue assets on the Ethereum Classic network. This will remove the need for these bridged assets in the long term. However bridges will continue to add value for interoperability with different L1's and L2 networks. We expect to see side-chains and rollups native to Ethereum Classic as the fee markets advance and topics like scalability of the protocol become front of mind.

Client Support and Miner Participation:
We intend to organize an open Ethereum Classic mining pool where miners can allocate their hashrate to this pool. A portion of the funds collected on this pool will go to supporting client maintenance and improved functionality and features. This allows miners to voluntarily participate in supporting the network and future proofs the essential software required to secure the network. This signals long term funding resources for client maintainers to plan their personal compensation around. This also removes the current middle men directing the client maintainers with 1099's or w2's. Rather we look forward to open client maintenance and an opportunity for a robust talent pool of client maintainers. This builds redundancies in a very pivotal area of the network's security. We expect client maintainers, miners, and mining pools will begin to have conversations about optimizing the clients, fixing any bugs, and adding feature sets that will improve the overall mining experience on Ethereum Classic as it moves from ""downstream"" development of ETH's clients to the primary ""upstream"" for the proof of work EVM ecosystem. Ethereum Classic has a long term commitment to Proof of Work and a healthy injection of open resources here is vital to the long-term health of the network.

LTS Funding Pool:
The LTS funding pool is oriented in a way which will grow to become self-sustaining via the mechanics of the positive feedback loop. As funds are collected from one protocol, another protocol will be developed that amplifies the protocol stack. In turn, the fund will grow at a higher rate enabling more protocols to turn online at a quicker rate. At some point, the fund will begin to grow at a rate the is completely self sustaining to the needs of the network. Therefore the immediate needs of the network will be addressed. This will begin the fund down a new path where it is accumulating excess funds. This will transition the funds priorities from organizing the ""needs"" of the network to addressing the ""wants"" of the network as the outlook of development moves to a more future driven approach. At this point, it is our intention to begin the exploration of decentralized distribution systems to allocate small portions of the funding pool to open governance mechanisms. We are not sure what will work, but our intention is to allocate small portions of the funding pool to specific, meaningful tasks and attempt different governance methods. Through this low risk approach, we expect to see governance methods completely fail and others show promise. Decentralized Governance and open funding for human labor is one of the biggest challenges to solve in the blockchain space. We do not believe we will accomplish this in our first attempts, but will do our best to stay open minded, mitigate the risk to the overall fund, and continue to try multiple methods as we rely on the scientific process to steer us to this end goal. All of these efforts will be made with the intention of decentralizing the funding process through many channels of distribution and methods. We believe this approach reduces overall risk to the development fund and builds redundancies in the funding channels. We understand this aspect of the project is very lofty and look forward to open involvement from the ETC community as we explore this goal.

We must iterate clearly, this is a very challenging goal. We intend to fail numerous times as we organize these decentralized and open distribution funding channels. And we will appropriately allocate funds to these tests with these risks top of mind. But to be clear, we will never ask the network to fork and rewrite the blockchain history should a governance system be exploited in this process. We welcome the open source community as we move down this journey to future proofing Ethereum Classic.

Code is law. Blockchains should be immutable. If Bitcoin is Plan B. Ethereum Classic is Plan C. Stay Classy.

Roadmap:

EthereumClassic.com - A Dashboard to Connect Users to the ETC protocol stack. ETC users come here to interact with the network.
Swap.EthereumClassic.com - Swap Functionality on ETC. On-chain liquidity to jumpstart the financial ecosystem on the network.
Bridge.EthereumClassic.com - Connect ETC and its local EVM ecosystem to the greater multi-EVM ecosystem. Port flagship products to the ETC network. Provide ramps for all participants.
Lend.EthereumClassic.com - Borrow/Lending protocols. APY/APR markets native on ETC.
Pool.EthereumClassic.com - An open Mining Pool where the fees go to supporting Client Maintainers. Allows miners/pools to participate in future proofing the software they rely on.
DAO.EthereumClassic.com - Build many governance systems for decentralized channels where developers can obtain funding for open source work on ETC.

We aspire to be the world’s simplest, fully decentralized prediction market experience and bridge new users into DeFi.

We also seek to experiment with different use cases for outcome tokens, the base primitive that powers prediction markets, including trading, insurance, information surfacing, skin in the game social discourse, bounty creation, and real-world ETF-like instruments that track public figures or trends.

In under two months live, Catnip has seen nearly $15M in trading volume. We are a community-driven project that collects no fees on Catnip usage, so we are looking toward grants to help drive this project forward. 

For a more in-depth description of how Catnip works, see here. 

Why Catnip? Catnip makes prediction markets more accessible and fun while maintaining total decentralization.

Catnip’s main benefits:

Simple - Catnip features a familiar, Uniswap-style UI with just two clicks to make a trade 

Liquid - our election market saw over $1M in liquidity

No limits - users can trade as much as they want 

Low tx fees - we route orders to minimize gas

Composable - since Catnip uses ERC20s as outcome tokens, they may be used across any DeFi apps. For example, our election tokens (yTrump and nTrump) were listed on Coingecko and traded via Balancer, Uniswap, Airswap, and Maskbook. 

Different currencies - while we think most markets benefit from stablecoin collateral, we are facilitating ETH, and other collateral types as need be

Decentralized oracle - in addition to fully non-custodial trading and decentralized liquidity provision, this lets us achieve censorship resistance, which is crucial for at-scale prediction markets

What we’ve done so far
Built foundry.finance, a facility for minting and wrapping (tokenizing) shares in Augur markets
Built out the Catnip UI with nearly $15M in trading volume in under two months live
Using CollabLand, built a skin in the game social channel for verified outcome token holders

What we’re working on/about to work on
More efficient pool construction and routing to minimize slippage  
Smart pools for improved liquidity and risk management for LPs
Integration of limit orders for early settlement

Quick back story, almost 3 years ago I got scammed 6 Bitcoin. It was my first experience with Bitcoin and it was painfull, but this experience trapped me and it made me go into the crypto rabbit hole. I am now obsessed on how crypto and blockchain will impact and change every aspect of our life.

Moving forward to the present, the universe decided to combine my new passion for crypto with another passion of mine which is music.

I co-founded Indieblock Records, a record label that is changing the music industry through collaboration, fair practices and blockchain technology.

A key aspect of Indieblock is our use of smart contracts, powered by Emanate, allowing for simplified business transactions and most importantly, fairly and transparently compensating collaborators and rights holders working with us.

We attempt to accomplish this goal through three main areas: 

Music Talent: Scouting and onboarding musical talent to the blockchain ecosystem 
Community Building: Building a strong community of music lovers and music creators.
Crypto Education: Educating the community on how to use crypto and blockchain technology.

You can support all of our efforts by making a donation to this grant - thank you to everyone who donates!

1403,geo-web-panvala-league,"SUPPORT THE OPEN METAVERSE
-
Geo Web is a set of open protocols & property rights for anchoring digital media to physical locations. 
 
It creates a decentralized consensus for an augmented, shared reality layer covering Earth guided by public good values rather than corporate profits. 
 
The Geo Web will bring digital media, gaming, data, commerce, and NFTs into the physical world as shared experiences rather than siloed applications. 
 
Why the Geo Web?
 
Large portions of our lives are shaped by our smart devices. This will only compound with the adoption of augmented reality smart glasses and other always-on wearables/embeddables. The foundations of our lived reality shouldn’t be defined by arbitrary app store rules and the subversive, never-ending drive for corporate profit growth.
 
We’re building the Geo Web because we think the metaverse should be based on permissionless, public good internet infrastructure. It should be an extension of the ethos/design of the internet, early web, and Ethereum.
 
The Geo Web is divided into digital land parcel NFTs which map 1:1 to the physical world. The market for digital land is administered under a partial common ownership (aka Harberger tax) system. Digital content can be anchored to the land utilizing our p2p content layer (Ceramic, IPFS, & Filecoin).
 
The Geo Web is a fair, efficient, and legitimate way to bootstrap and scale the metaverse across our shared planet. 
 
By reinvesting 100% of land market proceeds into rewarding open-source developers, creatives, advocates, users, and public goods, we can create compounding network utility and value. The Geo Web is a choice for positive-sum coordination over fixed-mindset tradition.
 
If the Geo Web is successful, we can help spur the adoption of partial common ownership systems beyond our network and help redefine global property rights systems to be fairer and more efficient.
 
Project Status (Updates since GR13)

We'll be launching a new testnet on Optimistic Kovan this week! Through the end of GR14, the testnet will be in ""fair launch mode"" with a Dutch auction claim system transitioning into open claims. Moving our testnet to an L2 allows us to decrease our grid size and make other optimizations that will be available for our mainnet launch.
We released new core smart contracts that utilize SuperFluid for streaming payment of partial common ownership (PCO) network fees. This new stream-based system is much more capital efficient for licensors than our previous deposit system and removes the conceptual hurdle of “land parcel expiration.” It also sets us up to create outgoing streams from the treasury to efficiently and sustainably fund public goods projects (lots of exciting possibilities!).
We modified our PCO auction mechanism to be more forgiving to current licensors. One of the biggest challenges PCO markets face is participants' fear of suddenly ""losing"" their prized possessions (note: they *are paid* for any asset transfers). Our new system keeps all land parcels for sale at the licensor's self-assessed value, but gives them 7 days to match an incoming bid by paying a proportional penalty. We think this will lower anxiety, but keep the market incentives aligned.
We initiated a Geo Web Data Models repo to house Geo Web-specific Ceramic schemas, definitions, and an SDK–the building blocks of our content layer. These schemas can be integrated into spatial browsers to enable an unlimited number of Geo Web use cases.
We sponsored a web3 onboarding cohort with Raid Guild. We sponsored bounties for participants to build educational material for partial common ownership and experiment with new implementations.
We onboarded several new open-source contributors--both technical and not! We continue to reward the community with SourceCred payouts and bounties. It feels like our messaging is starting to take hold and even gain momentum in the bear market.
 
What’s next?
 
The Graph very recently became available on zkSync 2.0, so we can proceed with the exploration of our zk-testnet. ZKPs are practically magic, so we’re obviously bullish on the long-term attributes of zk-rollups, but what Optimism is doing is impressive too. They’re shipping, committed to public goods, advancing governance design, and delivering Ethereum equivalence on L2. We’ll make our final decision on the L2 home for the Geo Web in the coming month or two while staying true to our long-term focus. 
 
We've been working and waiting for this opportunity for quite a while, so couldn't be more excited to push it across the line. We need to complete more testing, an audit, admin/legal prep for real money moving through the contracts, and LOTS of community development+marketing. We can't set a mainnet launch date yet, but it will be soonTM.

494,save-the-children,"As the global death rate increases due to the Coronavirus, children in over 120 countries are vulnerable to getting sick, living in quarantine or possibly being separated from their families. School closings are disrupting children’s education and the risks to the psychological impact this outbreak has on children grows.

Equally concerning is the possible spread of the virus to countries experiencing instability and conflict where the impact could more severe.

Keeping children safe is at the core of our work. Here is how Save the Children is responding to this crisis.

We are preparing response plans for all 120 countries where we work, with special attention to scenarios of high transmission rates in low-resource countries.

We are training health staff, ensuring that our staff stay healthy and providing health clinics with enough soap and hygiene supplies to prevent the spread of infection.

We are also prepared to provide children and their families with supplies including food, hygiene items, household supplies, and items that are specific to the needs of children.

Additional Information:
In terms of Save the Children's programmatic response, globally we started emergency response activities in China, Pakistan and Hong Kong in early February, and are preparing to deploy our Emergency Health Unit especially if there are outbreaks in countries with very week health infrastructure. Many of our most affected member countries (Italy, South Korea) are already providing resources for parents and kids in their countries.

Here in the U.S, we are working with our program staff and partners to make sure that children can continue to learn and receive meals - particularly in our program areas where lack of connectivity, safe childcare and food insecurity are major issues. In many areas where we work up to 100% of the kids get free or reduced fee school breakfast and lunches.

Triquetra, at its core, is a multi-purpose Twitter bot that tends to constantly push forward the buyer engagement of the NFT marketplace by developing a decentralized ecosystem in a form of a virtual art gallery.

Imagine, you are at a break/or on a weekend spending your leisure time on social media, especially `Twitter`, after spending days on making your first NFT art and looking for some trends and good times, and suddenly you recall, you don't have a fan following to look upon and sell your NFTs at great prices! well, Triquetra to the rescue. All you have to do is mention the bot and ask for the shoutout, it will grab the tweet spontaneously and will fetch the request alongside info of that NFT from Rarible 
 and OpenSea to make a new tweet and publish it on the NFT Twitter account of Triquetra, which will serve as a virtual art gallery.

What if you want to throw a giveaway or send out an airDrop on Twitter, but don't want to rely on other sources to handle it? Triquetra is here to automate tasks for you, the really cool thing about this giveaway is that it actually picks ""RANDOM"" users. How? Well using the `ChainLink's VRF API`, to sustain the oracle problem, this bot, after getting through some dramatic algorithm shifts, which is solely based on randomness provided by the API, get you your giveaway winners, and at the same time, will send out DMs to each one, for the process of how to avail them! Cool isn't it? To put the verifiable randomness of blockchain to use. Apart from these features, I am currently building a front-end website that will hold as a place to do tweet marketing and develop an NFT marketplace to deploy your own NFT. It will help users deploy on their favorite marketplaces and serve as a relayer for new NFT artists who want to amaze the world with their NFTs.

Keeping personal branding aside, what if you're launching off your first project in web3 space, and you are not backed up by well-known personas or you have not enough finance to pay to a market influencer to promote your project, cheers to Triquetra, it will provide you a decent reach to a global audience by leveraging web2 social media platforms such as Twitter to create a global hype and reach a mass audience worldwide. Based on your custom funds, a devised way of using those funds to create respective incentives to a most influencing member of the community will be engaged and hence a peer-to-peer profit of projects reaching mass audience and influencers being paid for influencing.

Similar to how Create React App works, Create Eth App enables frontend developers to generate a new Ethereum-powered app boilerplate with one command.

It comes with a wide offering of UI frameworks and DeFi templates to choose from:

yarn create eth-app --template aave
yarn create eth-app --template compound
yarn create eth-app --template sablier
yarn create eth-app --template uniswap

It only works with yarn v0.25 and above.

I built this because of a personal need to avoid copy-and-pasting boilerplate code when building an Ethereum app from scratch. The project has currently over 300 stars on GitHub and has been downloaded approximately 1,000 times from npm.

Since last round
With your support we have been able to 

Add utility scripts for deploying your app directly to IPFS
Include a wallet management boilerplate using web3Modal
Optimise the templating system to make the codebase more DRY reduce the unpacked size.
Added UniswapV2 to our list of DeFi templates
Upgrade all templates to use ethers.js v5

Funding
Donating to Create Eth App will enable us to work on the following things:

Add more DeFi templates (Balancer, 1inch, TokenSets, etc.)
Add templates that include smart contract development (atm all templates are bare frontend code)
Further optimise the templating system so to speed up installations and allow us to pack in more features

2487,kimchidao-developers-fund,"The KimchiDAO was created for the purpose of expanding the Kimchi Ecosytem and the Kimchi Community.

Why KimchiDAO?

When the KIMCHI token was created, it was created without any governance. 

When a token is lacking governance, it is completely disconnected from the community of people who own that token.

KimchiDAO aims to be that missing governance component for the KIMCHI token, connecting the community of token holders to the future success of the Greater Kimchi Project.

Through the organization of the DAO, we will be able to advance the KIMCHI token forward in a way that is inline with the desires of the token owners.

What is missing?

Part of the backbone of any project is it's developers and the work that they do. The chances of a project succeeding is very low if there is no active development continuing to push the project forward.

The KimchiDAO has been in talks with a few developers which could potentially revive active development of the Kimchi project.

What is the purpose?

The purpose of this Grant is to gather the funds necessary to pay developers for their work in advancing the Kimchi project.

How will the proceeds be distributed?

The KimchiDAO puts the power of decision making into the hands community. Decisions are made through a process of open voting, in which all KIMCHI token holders are able to vote in.

Likewise, the proceeds gathered as a result of this Grant will be used and distributed according to the decisions that the Community makes by voting.

Your part

The Greater Kimchi Project and the KIMCHI token have enormous potential.

3360,uncryptd-learning-to-web3-with-crypto-incentives,"The blockchain and web3 space have been expanding quickly every day, and yet not many know how to use Web3 products and services. Most people already know or have heard about cryptocurrencies but have only considered it or have learned about them as a speculative trading asset, rather than something with actual utility. To bridge the gap between Web3 and Web2, and to provide an easy and understandable way for beginners to onboard onto Web3 and discover its amazing use cases, this incentivized learning program was born.

We have received grants from Polygon and have curated a prize pool of 552 MATIC collectively for Round 1 and Round 2 of UNCRYPTD. We are actively looking to partner up with different DeFi protocols especially built on top of Polygon to introduce our participants to the larger DeFi ecosystem.

For Round 1, we specified tasks such as
Installing Metamask
Connecting to Polygon
and Minting their first NFT.

This allowed participants to get a flavor of the decentralized world with something familiar. For Round 2 we intend to introduce them to the world of DeFi.

UNCRYPTD Round 1 ended on 12th August 2021, and we look to conduct Round 2 soon. We look forward to using the funds used in these grants to incentivize users in navigating Web3. We will be using these funds to:
Incentivize Round 1 shortlisted participants in Round 2 for a chance at GRAND PRIZE
Incentivize Open Round participation where anyone from the public can participate directly in Round 2.
Add to the final GRAND PRIZE of UNCRYPTD V1
To the UNCRYPTD Team for sustainability.

Round 2 is officially in the works. We have received a grant from AAVE to push education of the protocol among newcomers into the space! We are grateful to all the support we have received ad our looking forward to create a fulfilling educational experience for the community in Round 2.

Recently we distributed the rewards for Round 1 of UNCRYPTD - 11.04 MATIC to each participant with a valid submission, totaling 276 MATIC (50% of the current prize pool). 



What makes us special is that not only do we expect users/participants to complete a set of objective tasks, we also require them to try their best and share what they have learned by creating some content on related topics and sharing it with the world. This not only instills a learning-in-public culture as they get to educate their peers on web3 hopefully creating a snowballing effect as we continue to grow.

Another aspect that makes us special is that we are OPEN for all to participate and learn, and we design our programs such that everyone is rewarded for their participation. UNCRYPTD takes place in Editions and Rounds, hence allowing us enough time to gather capital for consecutive rounds. 

We consider this to be a learning-focused content-based hackathon where users are incentivized to learn and create educational content. Although currently, we don't focus on Web3 development, it is in the plans to start creating learning paths for would-be developers to enter and learn how to build in this space with rewards incentivizing them.

We are looking to incentivize everyone who participates with a small monetary reward, while those who make better or more quality content getting a chance to earn more

For more background, pls see this exchange between CLR & Vitalik Buterin.

WHAT: 

We are soliciting crypto contributions to reward the highest-read Crypto Law Review article written by a law student in Q1 2020.

WHY:

Because we need to raise the level of crypto competence in the global legal bar. Writing competitions are popular ways to incentivize law students to produce high quality articles on legal topics of general interest. 

A crypto prize pool is the best way to reward a student's best efforts and to raise awareness about underlying crypto projects. Writing competitions are also known ways to incentivize authorship/readership --> higher overall profile/visibility for all stakeholders.

GROUND RULES: 

Prize open to law students who publish an article of any length at CLR in Q1 2020; 
Contributors may publish more than 1 article, but stats for only 1 highest-read article will be used;
""Highest-read"" = most unique article views (not ""reads,"" but views), per Medium stats;
Awardee must be a law student currently enrolled in any law school, globally (at any year level, from L1 to L10);
Prize will be awarded by CLR editorial board by April 7, 2020;
Editors reserve the right to add other rules as reasonably necessary.

ABOUT US:

4304,minimum-viable-salaries-for-scalability-and-inclu,"Minimum Viable Salaries are a tool to reward DAO's community contributors. The tool is designed to value trust, commitment, and context and is meant to work together with other tools such as bounties, grants and P2P mechanisms that reward value delivered and task completion.

The core concept is to enable token streams that start/stop based on other data inputs (such as achieving a certain threshold of contribution as valued by other tools such as bounties in a specific time period). This way ad-hoc contributors and bounty hunters can ""graduate"" into core contributors and receive a basic stipend to reward their ongoing commitment and value they provide as carriers of organisational knowledge. This way, Minimum Viable Salaries bridge the gap between core teams and community contributors.

You can read more about the rationale for Minimum Viable Salaries in this mirror article. 

This grant will support me, a UX designer and a developer in creating this tool open source, composable, and with a no-code UI.


Last round we had issues getting the grant approved in time for the round so we're giving it another go :)

1848,donations-to-hugh-karp-for-the-recent-hack-of-per,"Many of you will have been made aware of the unfortunate news Hugh Karp, the founder of NXM, was hacked for around 370,000 NXM tokens (c$8m) last week.

The hack was sophisticated - Hugh had followed good practice in utilizing a hardware wallet to sign transactions, but this hack was able to to bypass this additional safety layer by installing a modified and malicious MetaMask extension – tricking him into signing a different transaction that transferred funds to the attacker’s own address. 

In a similar vein to flashloan exploits, whilst it is painful for those who lose their funds, learning from each new attack strengthens the whole of DeFi and makes it a more secure environment for everyone else.

In this case, Hugh has not only been instrumental in providing an invaluable public good of insurance for DeFi users and protocols through the NXM project, but he has also now taken an enourmous personal hit for this exploit which we will all learn from and hopefully protect ourselves from going forward. And his immediate response to losing a life changing sum of money? To continue building NXM to make DeFi more secure for us all.

I would ask that all users who feel they would benefit from taking measures to improve their own wallet security based on the learnings from this exploit, as well as protocols who have benefitted from the insurance NXM has provided for their users and have treasuries to fund a donation to Hugh, to please do so.

We now have a nice front facing Notion page created by our very own 0xZFi!

We are forming the first and best content creators coalition dedicated to all things Aavegotchi; a DeFi Play-and-Earn MMORPG built on Polygon. This is our third Gitcoin Grants participation round and we appreciate all the support shown from round 12 to here. We have grown our number of users from within the community that produce quality, informative and entertaining content. You can help us focus and empower these true #GotchiGang supporters and create one of Aavegotchi's strongest specialized interest groups at GMI 👻👻👻

Frenless Summer is still hard at work and recently released episode two of the Nine Aadepts, a humble fan fiction script growing into a full blown masterpiece spacious production. You can review that script here: The Nine Aadepts: Episode Two. Keep your eyes peeled for a live reading of this script soon, brought to you by authentic #GotchiGang community members. This is an ongoing production led by Frenless, aided closely by the AavegotchiDAO as well as Bin Laggin and promises to deliver beyond all current expectations. This is a true work of passion and GMI is thrilled to support in all ways possible. 🤝

Hope you didn't miss out on our mind numbingly fun 4/20 drop of the GMI One Hit Wonder, a killer collaboration between NoFuturistic x Bin Laggin. If you have one, hodl dearly frens. These are far too few in numbers. 👀

Smokescreens has also stepped up to help provide comprehensive support to the Spanish speaking community entering the Gotchiverse. Language will be no limit for us.

Our members provide a wealth of content creation for Aavegotchi across various mediums. But we want MOAR. We currently produce material for podcasts, youtube, twitter spaces and twitch via the following member productions:

	Music City Gotchi Gang
	Aavegotchi Pacific Chapter
    Gotchi Creator Community
    Roxiano-Gotchi
    Zombie Shepard
    Aavegotchi Self Portraits

This grant request is to continue in the establishment of the Gotchiverse Media International treasury and will bootstrap one of the earliest emerging community operated industries. These funds will be placed in a Gnosis multi-sig vault (matic:0x376184461aaa5Bd445cd52924Fdf29e8E4b86900) and staked in DeFi positions, usually in Aavegotchi directly, to generate yields that will be utilized for coalition goals such as generating frens, gltr, tickets and funding requests to be evaluated by members. 

At the very least, please take a moment to enjoy some of our dedicated members content. We all work very hard on this material and it is currently a labor of complete love. 

May your channelings be blessed and your alchemica be dense! With frens like you, we are definitely GMI.

This project was created in order to support a new internet. One that is more open, free, and censorship-resistant in comparison to the old internet. An internet that eventually wouldn't need to rely on telecom towers, an outdated grid, or all these other ""old school"" forms of tech. We believe P2P compatibility is an important part of the future of the net. Grid Computing also plays a role in having a better means of transferring information in a speedy, more cost-efficient and reliable manner.

1016,the-datafruits-fund,"Update, still welcoming any donations!! Appreciate the support, thank you so much.

Datafruits.fm strives to be a place where anyone with good intentions regardless of their location or connections can create a music stream free from the traditional trappings of web 2.0 platforms. Why stream alone on Twitch when you can be part of a community that values you as a person and your work.

Mainstream platforms don’t encourage working together, you traditionally start a youtube or twitch channel alone, an instagram for yourself only. Working together would increase our power, and that’s not what these platforms want. They want to extract our creative labour for their profits.

While there are many internet radio stations out there, we want to focus on giving those a voice who may not have one normally. Marginalized groups, even people who just aren’t close to a major city may have difficulty finding their local music community. Historically musicians flock towards major cities, New York, L.A., London, Tokyo. Why can’t someone living in the middle of the country be given the same affordances?

Starting from a love labour born out of my obsession with UK pirate radio stations and Japanese netlabels, datafruits has turned into an international community where people from different parts of the country can connect, and IRL friendships and connections have been made.

Before and after the pandemic, while its only a chatroom and live stream, many people feel datafruits have provided them a non-exploitive place to connect with others. We have no advertisements, the site is funded by myself and contributions from a Patreon account. In addition the network of artists that datafruits is a part of has helped people collect funds through bandcamp releases, gofundme and patreon campaigns and more. 

When covid hit we started a week long party called DXDF. This coincided with starting mutual aid in our discord later on. Multiple labels and communities have sprung out of datafruits, creating a sort of informal ad-hoc mutual aid network. When someone posts their gofundme, we have enough of an informal network to make it happen.

Since datafruits is open to really anyone who is interested in streaming their music with us, barring approval from the community, which is really just a process to weed out anyone potentially harmful, I would say datafruits.fm qualifies as a public good.

With streampusher, the open source radio management software that powers datafruits, the possibilities for a public good become even further. My goal for this software is to have it as easy to spin up your own radio station as it is to start your own discourse server. We wouldn’t collect any subscription fees, this would just be an open source project that anyone can run and customize.

While we merely distribute funds in an ad-hoc fashion for now given our limited funding, it is my vision to grow into a fully formalized cooperative that supports artists basic needs and beyond.

959,0confirmation,"0 confirmation is a fully bootstrapped project that has sprung out of the renprotocol community. This grant request is to help fund an audit, 100% of what is raised through this grant will go directly into paying for a public audit of the 0confirmation code base.

We have built a general purpose decentralized messaging and lending protocol that separates underwriting from liquidity which opens up a much larger design space than current lending protocols where the underwriting is done at the protocol level (Maker, Compound, Aave, etc.)

The first implementation of this protocol is 0cf Swap. It is an app that allows you to swap real bitcoin, directly from an exchange or your hardware wallet, for DAI in only a few minutes, instead of waiting for a full 6 confirmations. It is accomplished by using the yet to be confirmed bitcoin transaction as collateral for a loan from a liquidity pool. The cross chain shift is handled by renVM.

We are currently live on kovan+BTC testnet and have released our plan for scaled, limited releases on mainnet. 0confirmation is already mostly open sourced (will be fully open for mainnet launch) and once the project proves a level of maturity we will kick off a plan to fully decentralize its management as well.

The Nym network is a decentralized mixnet to support anonymity and unlinkability at the network layer (layer 0) across any blockchain and application. Unlike Tor and Katzenpost/Meson, Nym uses blockchains in order not to have a central directory and uses incentives to decentralize the mix network itself. Due to cover traffic and timing delays based on the Loopix design, Nym provides superior privacy than both VPNs and Tor, and can be integrated to communicate with any blockchain to enable communication without censorship or fear. Nym fills in the missing pieces of the cryptographic revolution necessary to end mass surveillance.
Learn more from our litepaper.

Team Nym
The Nym team is comprised by established coders and researchers in privacy-enhancing technologies.
Harry Halpin, CEO is a renowned computer scientist and a leader in the movement against mass surveillance who worked under web inventor Tim Berners-Lee at the World Wide Web Consortium, lead NEXTLEAP and PANORAMIX, amongst other accomplishments.
Claudia Diaz, CSO (Chief Science Officer) with 20 years working on privacy-enhancing technologies, she is one of Europe’s preeminent researchers in the field recognized for her contribution to the foundations of metadata protection from surveillance, traffic analysis, tracking, localization and behavioral profiling.
Dave Hrycyszyn, CTO has founded, built and sold several companies from Chainspace, Blockmainia, and the Vega protocol. He is a co-author of the blockchain-sharding protocol Chainspace and the leaderless, PBFT-variant consensus protocol Blockmania, the prototype of which turned out to be likely the world’s fastest distributed ledger (400,000 TPS with 2 secs finality).
Jedrzej Stuczynski, Lead Developer has a Master of Engineering in Computer Science with First Class Honours from University College London. During his thesis work he studied the Coconut signature scheme under the supervision of George Danezis and then implemented it.
Ania Piotrowska, Head of Research has masters degree with specialization in Analysis of Algorithms from the Faculty of Fundamental Problems of Technology at Wroclaw University of Technology and is a designer of the Loopix mixnet, with her PhD advisor and original Nym and Chainspace co-founder George Danezis.

Funded in 2017, Trips Community is a DAO in the travel space.
We are focused on experimenting and have launched the first ever travel booking via NFT with a Villa in Spain and the first ever NFT hotel booking with a 5 stars in Venice, Italy.

The Travel Open Protocols Fund

🌴 The travel industry is very fragmented and heavily dependent on centralised platforms.
In the years since 2017 very little has been created in terms of open protocols, and this is mainly due to the low rate of web3 adoption in the industry.
We think this is a good time to start building the infrastructure and get ready for when mass adoption comes.
There are today already enough web3 savvy users who will be able to get value from them and get at least some traction.

The TRIPS COMMUNITY TRAVEL OPEN PROTOCOLS FUND is raising funds to create a DAO incubator dedicated to the travel industry open protocols.
Startups and individual devs will be able to apply and receive funding to build public goods for the travel industry.

🚀 STARTUPS AND DEVS
If you are a startup or a lone Dev you can also raise directly in Gitcoin of course: we encourage you to do so, while also applying to us.
We can offer you funds, a 10k+ strong Community to test your ideas and code and over 20 years of experience in the industry.

**Being lazy doesn't quite means we cannot buy NFTs.** Even NFTs are now lazily mintable. Web3 storage facility provided by **Crust Network** and IPFS change how we store our data. With every other protocol emerging in web3, we still lag a massive user adoption and frictionless services embedded within our everyday engagements on the internet. People tend to practice their usual choices over picking new, advanced, decentralized web3 services. Another gap quite buzzing around in the web3 space is community lack a developer behavior alongside an entrepreneurial spirit, which stops them from letting the world watch their artwork live over virtual galleries and auctions. Community, if provided with embedded solutions within our reach, can potentially emerge as a game-changer to attract mass user adoption to these technologies.

What it does
“Hmm… I wonder if you are a new artist and recently opened a new account on Twitter, followers being limited to just your friends and families, looking for the options to get your work to wider audience overtime, provide your customers a payment solution to buy NFTs just two clicks away, and of course, get yourself some credits for being recognized in space?"" worry not! Quartile, in itself, is an embedded solution to those new emerging artists who are finding their way into web3 space and calibrating a revenue stream out of the NFT marketplaces.

Being built on top of **Rarible Protocol** in Etherum and on **Paras** in NEAR, it allows users to lazy mint NFTs on multiple marketplaces, with **cross-chain** support for multiple blockchains in near future via integrating **rainbow-bridge-cli**, will help users get an edge over paying high gas fees. With NFT payment solutions as innovative as buying them through Twitter DMs is fascinating to customers as they don't need laptops anymore. “You can go for a walk in the evening scrolling through tweets wondering which cool one to buy and just DM the bot to buy one, it will do everything for you, of course except **Private Key**.”

It also provides artists who **lazy mint NFTs** through our project, an option to get tweeted by the account to gain customer attraction. It allows users to leverage the concept of **Proof of Existence** on the grounds of **nft.storage** and **crust.network** powered by **IPFS**.

Furthermore, it allows users full control over handling their assets, meanwhile providing a wide range of accessibility to transfer them into on-chain assets for buying and selling NFTs on different blockchains.

How we built it
Using the process of lazy minting through messaging with image links, users can decide what additions/details would they like to add to this NFT.

Options available:
Custom Royalty splits
Lazy Minting NFTs with Trade offer
Minting with Attributes/Data

Adding upon this, using the tech stack of **Rarepress** and **Nebulus** backed by Rarible Protocol SDK, allows my project to leverage web3 powered NFT storage facility as well as writing scripts to customize NFT according to user's needs. At the moment, the project only supports buying NFTs worth static prices, but in the near future, I am looking forward to expanding it to a live auction on Twitter as well as opening it up to **Paras** as well as other NFT marketplaces on NEAR. Using Python to engage users with the bot and using Javascript to rely on the process of minting is what provides a sense of decentralized workload across programming languages and keeps it modularized while executing. Additional features include using web3.storage to provide a personal space for users to keep their precious memories safe on a decentralized network.

Challenges we ran into
Joining bot framework with minting and trading scripts of NEAR SDK.
Surfacing the bot framework to be eligible to safely and precisely create the NFT according to the user's customized options.
Adding the web app to automatically create the message and prompt users directly to sanction and purchase the NFT.
Adding support to basically mint any image file publicly accessible over the internet.
How to fetch attributes from users in a minimal way to help them customize their NFT.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Able to successfully read data from human-readable chat to data modeling for minting NFT.
Able to create a buy order through chats for static-price indexed NFTs.
Able to render and process payments checkout limited to two clicks, by automating all the hashes and order permission encoded within backend scripts for a seamless UX.
Able to provide full-scale flexibility for royalty splits.
Leveraging the zero-to-no-cost gas fees solution to quickly execute txns
Chainlink VRF-powered giveaway [Code, Demo Video, Used as a separate product by: EthIndia, Chainlink Community]

What I learned
Building an MVP
Interaction between different tech stacks
Lazy Minting an NFT
Custom Royalties provide users governance rights through NEAR tokens
Understanding concepts of Typescript in a web app
Learned NEAR SDK as well as integrations of NEAR-powered NFT marketplaces like Paras.

What's next for Quartile
Advanced version where we can host live auction on Twitter for a limited time to race for buying yet expensive and valuable NFTs recognized by their renowned artists.
Adding Rainbow bridge into the DApp in order to provide users an upper hand over purchasing **NEAR NFTs** with **ERC20** tokens.
Adding Cross Chain Support to blockchains including Binance, Polkadot, Flow, Polygon, and Tezos.
NFTs mintable only by specific address in case of ownership.
To provide support end for various multi-sig wallets in order to broaden the range of usability on the customer end.
Create custom-curated airdrops where people having their wallet address in the description will receive tokens, with voluntary participation in events through retweets and other engagements.

155,tensortrade-trade-efficiently-with-reinforcement-,"TensorTrade is an open source Python framework for building, training, evaluating, and deploying robust trading algorithms using reinforcement learning. The framework focuses on being highly composable and extensible, to allow the system to scale from simple trading strategies on a single CPU, to complex investment strategies run on a distribution of HPC machines.

Under the hood, the framework uses many of the APIs from existing machine learning libraries to maintain high quality data pipelines and learning models. One of the main goals of TensorTrade is to enable fast experimentation with algorithmic trading strategies, by leveraging the existing tools and pipelines provided by numpy, pandas, gym, keras, and tensorflow.

Every piece of the framework is split up into re-usable components, allowing you to take advantage of the general use components built by the community, while keeping your proprietary features private. The aim is to simplify the process of testing and deploying robust trading agents using deep reinforcement learning, to allow you and I to focus on creating profitable strategies.

The goal of this framework is to enable fast experimentation, while maintaining production-quality data pipelines.

Guiding principles
Inspired by Keras’ guiding principles.

User friendliness. TensorTrade is an API designed for human beings, not machines. It puts user experience front and center. TensorTrade follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear and actionable feedback upon user error.

Modularity. A trading environment is a conglomeration of fully configurable modules that can be plugged together with as few restrictions as possible. In particular, instrument exchanges, feature pipelines, action strategies, reward strategies, trading agents, and performance reports are all standalone modules that you can combine to create new trading environments.

Easy extensibility. New modules are simple to add (as new classes and functions), and existing modules provide ample examples. To be able to easily create new modules allows for total expressiveness, making TensorTrade suitable for advanced research and production use.

Footbopoly is the first football DeFi and NFT-based investment platform where you can buy NFT football card and enjoy your rewards along with the other features.
Everyone can become a part of the football world where you can manage your own football team and get much more coming soon opportunities.
Each card you invest in is an NFT and your rewards are managed by a contract which makes it fully DeFi based. This guarantees timely paid rewards according to reward period of the league your card belongs to. The mission of Footbopoly is to combine the NFT, DeFi and football worlds into the platform for investors and football fans.

  How It Works?
Choose your asset (project starts with 3 Leagues and 4 types of players available)
Choose league you want to play in, player position and player skills (price and APY are calculated dynamically)
Buy the player
Get your rewards according to League payment period
Enjoy the game and wait for new assets and game features (it will become more and more entertaining).

We have our demo environment based on Ropsten test network live here already so everyone can buy a card with test ETH and see how it works. It remains available until main platform start.
To make process easier we made step by step video where you can see how to buy your first card on Demo.


  Footbopoly Tokens
  Our platform has it’s own ERC20 token — FOOT, it will be used for all purchases and payments inside the platform. Football cards (NFT’s) are native ERC-721 token which has a symbol FIFA — First Investment Football Asset.

  Team and Future Plans
  Footbopoly team are 3-D shaped — young, innovative and experienced. The team has huge expertise in Tech field, management and are open minded for innovations. We follow Spotify Agile model so our team is T-shaped, which means each member of the team has at least two competencies. Team inspiration leader is Sergey Prykhodko, who is the domain expert and main ideas generator. Vitaliy Nemudriy is a project Tech lead, Designer and financial expert. Oleksandr Riznyk is a marketing specialist and innovation leader. Every team member is a passionate fullstack developer with his own vision of future.

  We dreem big!
  The goal of our project is to become the universal crypto portal for Football fans. On this portal, all known football activities and blockchain fairness meet together.
Our dream is to create a fully blockchain-powered football team in which all investors (NFT holders) can make decisions of all levels and get the interest from profit earned by the group. Imagine how we can get any player to our team by simply adding some funds to the special smart contract or buying special NFT (by all community members).
  At the beginning of the project, the following features will be available:
Own cryptocurrency
NFT platform
Salary and staking payouts
  The following functions to be implemented after application release:
Football clubs, contracts and seasons gameplay
Football statistic and news
Staking for non-NFT holders

BooksOnChain is poised to become the go-to decentralized ecosystem for Digital Readable Content creators and users. Our platform will allow anyone to create and monetize his own creations in a secure (anti-piracy) and censorship-free way.

Focusing on 4 main goals in its first development phase, BooksOnChains aims to provide e-Books and other readable digital content with all the advantages of the Blockchain in terms of ownership of digital assets and censorship resistance transforming e-books on NFT (Non Fungible Tokens). This translates in authors being able to publish their own content, with the assurance that it will be only read by the people who actually got the asset (paid or free).

BooksOnChain will provide an interactive dashboard both for users and for authors in which authors will find an easy way of minting its own NFT from their work, and sell it. Users on the other side will find a storefront of all the authors to buy, borrow, or subscribe to their work.

The BooksOnChain platform is powered by its own Native token, QUILL, an ERC-20 Token built on the Ethereum Blockchain. The QUILL token will be used for discounts on purchases or subscriptions in the platform, dividends from staking and as a governance token allowing the community to vote on how the project will evolve. Staking the tokens will allow holders to receive a share of all the said fees that are paid in QUILL. 

BooksOnChain was born for the purpose of empowering all the talent lost in readable content due to the several barriers and middlemans present in the digital readable contents industry, like publishing companies, etc. And to end piracy one and for all, since thanks to the blockchain features all content will be encrypted and only the real owners will be able to read it.

And lastly, but not least, BooksOnChain will help fight digital readable content piracy, developing an e-Book reader which will integrate with the most relevant ERC-20 wallets to be able to read all the NFT e-books.

2021.12.01 UPDATE

TEC’s mission is to become the focal point for token engineering by funding the development of proposals that seek to create open source tools & research, educational material, and token engineering narratives that advance this new discipline.

After raising 1,571,223 wxDai during our Hatch (phase 1 of our project), we’ve now built the first tool in our arsenal: a Commons Configuration Dashboard (CCD). This enables community members to propose economic designs by creating custom parameters for our Augmented Bonding Curve and Conviction Voting modules (check it out here: https://config.tecommons.org/)

We’re currently using our CCD to compare, contrast, and propose different combinations of parameters for our DAO; one of these sets will eventually frame the implementation of our funds during our Commons Upgrade initialization (phase 2). When we're done proposing, TECH token holders will have the opportunity to vote for their favorite proposal submissions. Then, in January, we will deploy the TEC Garden with the Augmented Bonding Curve, according to the parameters chosen by the community.

We have built it—the first collectively-engineered Commons. Now, will you come join us?

✨ We are so excited to announce the Hatch was successful! On August 14th, we met and surpassed our minimum goal of 800,000 wxDai to reach a total of 1,571,223.57 wxDai. 🎉

The TEC is officially a DAO and in the midst of Phase2 of development: the Commons Upgrade. All thanks to the support of the expanding TEC community! Upon upgrade, the TE Commons will begin accepting project proposals to fund token engineering research, education, and outreach. Equally as important, the selected Commons parameters will establish the bonding curve. After the Hatch-to-Commons fund transfer vote, TECH Hatch tokens will be replaced by TEC tokens, and the TEC Commons comes to life! For all the important details on next steps 👇

THE TOKEN ENGINEERING COMMONS

The Token Engineering Commons (TEC) is an open source and collectively governed project that aims to create a token economy to accelerate the Token Engineering field through responsible & ethical creation of public goods for the TE community. This grant will support the ongoing TEC deployment efforts.



🌱 We are a blossoming and inclusive community with over 400 contributors from around the world and growing. Here's a shot from one of our community calls on Thursdays - we warmly welcome you to join us on the TEC Discord! 

The Token Engineering Commons is based off of 1Hive’s Gardens template and intends to upgrade into a bonding curve that feeds into a conviction voting DAO. Once launched, the TEC (smart contracts and culture) will align incentives around advancing the token engineering discipline. 

Additionally, the TEC is the Iteration 0 “Field Test” of the Commons Stack’s Flagship Commons.The Commons Stack will ensure others can take the model created here and deploy it for their own use case.

To find out more about the TEC & how you can become involved and contribute, check out this brilliant TEC overview video from ETH Denver 2021. Livia focuses on the people behind the TEC, automated vs. autonomous, and why a sense of belonging is critical to the upcoming TEC Hatch.

We task ourselves with promoting a balanced organizational culture in the blockchain space and empowerment of women-blockchain-pioneers and early adopters.  

DAOJanes will seek to champion emotionally intelligent organizational practices that foster natural social harmony, balance, and mutual appreciation within the blockchain ecosystem.

As we develop our DAO canvas we are exploring 
support of and investment in women in blockchain, 
content creation and shared initiatives for:
exploration of emotional intelligence, 
constructive relationship and community dynamics, 
co-creation of balanced and nurturing community value-sets.

We aim to target the following UN Sustainable Development Goals and Metrics:
Goal 5: Achieve Gender equality and empower all women & girls
Goal 5B: Enhancing the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women

Metrics & Indicators: 
# of community members reached within the program
% of community members who report they have grown professionally since joining the community
% of community members who report they have benefited since joining the community
# of community members who have left the community since joining 
% of companies that have felt an impact in their organizational team

We chose to become a DAO to inspire and unite a truly empowered community. We seek to be an open DAO, an inclusive and diverse community and we appreciate immensely the men and women who have inspired and supported our early efforts as well as those who will become friends, colleagues, and participants of our community in the future.

We are delighted to invite DAOists and projects interested in investing in women and emotionally intelligent organisational practices in blockchain to join us in funding, building and promoting DAOJanes as we embark on our journey of peace, balance, and emotional prosperity.

We want to create a collaborative and global common allowing any creator to facilitate the transmission of his rights on the internet thanks to NFTs. We want to allow creators to enter the world of NFTs and benefit from the advantages offered by the blockchain in a healthy and secure way. We want to put the power of surveillance and justice back into the hands of the community, which feels concerned by respecting the copyright of our creators.

-Earning a living as an artist and creator is a challenge. The art NFT market helps some artists who specialize in creating digital art. But it is not the majority. Serious art projects find it difficult to make a place for this as they are drowned in online scams. Many artists would also like to share their creations and not just the cryptographic hash of their digital files.
 
- Current NFT standards do not allow creators to prove their authorship on their creations or to secure and monetize their copyright through their NFT. They also do not prevent acts of counterfeiting. This created division and friction within the creative universe.
 
- Free licenses allow you to share rights without being able to monetize them 
 
Solution : We have developed a new secure and legal standard License in over 177 countries around the world. 

These standards answer to these questions :

- What am I allowed to do with the creation associated with my NFT?
- What am I NOT allowed to do with the creation associated with my NFT?

​What are these standards License ?

Standard License helps creators to sell through NFT royalties, commercial use over their creation and even physical goods like famous unisocks!.

Black Girls CODE is devoted to showing the world that black girls can code, and do so much more. By reaching out to the community through workshops and after school programs, Black Girls CODE introduces computer coding lessons to young girls from underrepresented communities in programming languages such as Scratch or Ruby on Rails. Black Girls CODE has set out to prove to the world that girls of every color have the skills to become the programmers of tomorrow. By promoting classes and programs we hope to grow the number of women of color working in technology and give underprivileged girls a chance to become the masters of their technological worlds. Black Girls CODE's ultimate goal is to provide African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. by 2020, and to train 1 million girls by 2040.

Through community outreach programs such as workshops and after school programs, we introduce underprivileged girls to basic programming skills in languages like Scratch and Ruby on Rails. Introducing girls of color to these skills gives them an introduction to today’s computer technology, an essential tool for surviving in the 21st century. The skills they acquire through the programs give these young women a chance at well-paying professions with prestigious companies, as well as the ability to enter into the field as an entrepreneurs and leaders of technology.

“Imagine. Build. Create.” has always been our motto at Black Girls CODE. The digital divide is steadily eroding, but if we want to create truly universal access to technology, San Francisco needs to come together as a community. Imagine a world where everyone is given the tools to succeed, and then help us build ways for everyone to access information and create a new age of women of color in technology.  

As of 2013, Black Girls CODE has 7 established institutions, and has operated in 7 states in the U.S. as well as Johannesburg, South Africa. We've reached over 3,000 students, and we plan to expand to 8 more cities in the United States.

We're excited to be working with the cryptocurrency community to help us raise funds! Thank you for your support.",https://www.blackgirlscode.com/,902,911,25,45,1,https://github.com/thegivingblock,1

1. Data-mining and data visualization.

2. Trading strategy visual design and testing.

3. Trading automation, including coordinated deployments of unlimited numbers of bots over a coordinated network of nodes (trading farm).

The Grant

Superalgos has started works to integrate Ethereum and needs help. The goal is to enable users to:

1. Connect to their Ethereum node right from within Superalgos using the visual interface.

2. Mine blockchain data to access coin and contract information for all Ethereum-based projects.

3. Process blockchain data into technical studies and indicators.

4. Visualize blockchain data on timeline/market charts.

5. Consume blockchain data from within trading systems to add a new layer of trading intelligence.

Note: Superalgos already does all of the above for market data originating at centralized exchanges.

Why Fund This Grant

Superalgos is playing a crucial role in making professional grade crypto trading automation available to everyone, free of charge, in a trustless application running on users' premises, with no intermediaries.

The scope of the grant brings value to the Ethereum network, projects, users, and developers.

For the network: Users of Superalgos will have an incentive to run an Ethereum node to make data-mining the blockchain possible.

1708,wallid,"What is WalliD?

WalliD integrates certified ID document infrastructures (PKIs) from all over the world and connects them to the web-3, allowing users to digitize their physical ID documents, encrypt and store them on the blockchain using their Wallets as gateway.

WalliD provides the tools for users to store their ID documents in their desktops or phones while maintaining total ownership of their data - You will never need to create an account or share any personal data with us. Everything is handled and protected by your wallet. All data stored on the blockchain or any other components related to the protocol are encrypted with your own keys and you are their sole owner.

WalliD also delivers a set of technological components to be used for online services in order to request and validate users’ ID documents issued by CAs, directly in their technological infrastructures - PKIs - Everything happens in their websites or apps and they directly request your authorisation to access your wallet and share your ID documents. We are a team of developers on a quest to deliver full ownership to online users when it comes to their ID data and we will keep working everyday to make it as easy and useful as it is to turn your phone or desktop on.

 

Users' privacy and safety on the protocol



All ID data is encrypted with user’s wallet private keys and only the user has the ability to decrypt it.
All the interactions with the protocol components are handled by user’s wallet in browser or phone, eliminating the need to have accounts or logins.
Not even WalliD components have access to users’ data when they're manipulating it.
Data is only decrypted directly on users' trusted services. No more documents travelling through unsafe channels.
 

We dream of a world where owning and using an ID document in the digital space is as easy and safe as it is in the real world

Our daily activities have been greatly shifting to the digital world and a high volume of them require identity validation processes to be safely or legally completed. In the current days, users often need to take pictures of their ID documents and send them through unsafe channels multiple times,exposing their ID data to high risks of potential fraud. For businesses these ID validations are also a burden since they are extremely unfriendly to their users, take from 12 hours to 4 days to be complete and require expensive processes to implement and rely on third parties and human intervention as middle men. However, with the existing technology of digital certificates and public key infrastructures (PKI), there’s actually no reason for the existence of such archaic processes - It is mathematically possible to be sure that the ID document being presented belongs to right person according to a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) like a government.



Cryptographic proofs-of-identity



Blockchain Powered Safety:

WalliD is built on top of the Ethereum Blockchain and users can interact with it through their wallets in their desktops or mobile devices at anytime and anywhere
All iD Data handled by WalliD is protected and encrypted by users' wallet keys and he their sole owner.
Users' ID attributes are stored in WalliD's smart contract, ensuring the data integrity of future ID related transactions.


Trustless Validations:

Certified Documents are always verified within Certificate Authorities infrastructures (PKI) and do not depend on any middle men.
WalliD validator (VerifyiD) connects users’ IDs to CAs’ PKIs and provides a proof of the methods applied in it.


Digital Certificates at the roots of the ID documents:

The protocol is only compatible with documents with digital certificates attached.
Digital Certificates are used as a mathematical proof of ownership for an ID document.
All documents stored and shared through WalliD components are able to provide a chain of trust from their issuer to their owner verifiable in a trustless way.

grant program

This is a special Gitcoin grant that is part of the panvala league matching campaign. while this grant accepts all donations, donations made in $PAN will receive extra matching through the panvala league.

how to get us matching

you can increase our $PAN matching in two (2) ways:

1: donating PAN to this Grant 

2: staking PAN to future modern

how to get $PAN
 
1) install metamask *in your browser* (firefox, chrome, or similar), not on your phone, here

2) put some ethereum in your metamask wallet. can buy here or ask us for help in our discord.

3) buy PAN at market price on Uniswap here. always choose ""fast"" speed, not ""average"", so your exchange or any transaction you do on metamask actually goes through.

to view and manage your $PAN...

1) in your metamask go to assets --> add token --> custom token 

2) input the contract address below: 0xD56daC73A4d6766464b38ec6D91eB45Ce7457c44 (THIS IS NOT A WALLET ADDRESS. DO NOT SEND TOKENS TO THIS ADDRESS.)

grant goals

We’ll distribute the funds we raise depending on how much you donate, how much matching we receive from the Ethereum Foundation, and how much extra matching we receive from Panvala for donations made with PAN.

base goal

Our base goal awards the first $500 funds received to @odd_galaxy_, for their contribution to the $BU1DL token community. 

their video content creation continues to curate undervalued artists into web3 the right way! 

goal 1: $500

If your donations and matching exceed $500, we’ll award the next $500 to Choirboy Dank, for their contribution to the $BU1DL token community.

Choirboy continues to up the vibes in our discord. Congrats on selling your first nft!

goal 2: $1,000

If your donations and matching exceed $1,000, we’ll award ½ of the next $1000 to Verbs, for their contributions to the $BU1DL token community.

Verbs keeps dropping the most fun art in our token gated discord. congrats on selling your second nft and first music nft!

goal 3: $2,000 or more

any remaining funds in excess of $2,000 will go towards liquidity for $BU1DL, our culture token capturing value for undervalued artists and culture whose impact has gone under-recognized.

pay ratio are 1 to 3 ; 1 to 6 ; 1 to 14.

User must be on Room Host Private Address list to be able to access the Boost Room. 
When you enter the room after sign contract agreement, user then must pick a seat at a table. 
the random number generator pair is started. 
Winner to ""Zed Run"" horse race, numbers from 1-12, then gets picked for the winner of the Room. 
however, to make it purely luck, the Random Generator Pair may not correlate to the actually number that wins. 
For example, using ""Zed Run' as my example game. Horse in Lane 5 wins the race, however the Random Number Generator Pair prints out 5::3. 
so the Winner of the game is actually, person sitting in Seat associated to the number 3, NOT the number 5. 
The point is to remove strategy, and go at your chances with LUCK,. for a evening or hour of fun with friends in a private game. 
Bets are called Boost. 
gamer Manager are called Room Host

The Room Host can use any event with the winnings being in a 1- 12. list. or any number list you can select in the beginning of the Game. For example, we do a Blockchain Trivia Night, but add it to a Boost Party. and we create a winning Chart correlation that answers given in  1-3seconds range are number 1 ;; 3-5s  = 2;;5-7s = 3 ;; etc.. and so forth. or however way the Room host decides to do. Which is why the room host is NOT allowed to enter room and sit at the Table.

- Full Support for Metamask and Formatic
- Integration with Gitcoin, Sablier, Compound, and Unlock
- Delivery of emails, slack messages, telegram messages and SMS
- Pay per use payment. Start the draft.
- Dapp to control integrations

Where Synapzys is?
Currently, we're developing the service to monitor all events and deliver notifications. Also, we're making a new skin for Synapxyz and creating mockups for the Dapp based on the new skin.

Expected Beta Release: 
April 29, 2020, is the date to open the beta release.

Where have we born?
We born here in gitcoin as a proposal for the From 0-To-1: Growth Hacking Your Viral DApp Idea judged by ConsenSys, we win the prize and the prize was inverted in creating the new skin and start the technical development of Synapxyz. https://gitcoin.co/issue/ConsenSys/Relays/1/3950

Who are our competitors?
The most prominent competitors are Zapier and IFTTT but in the blockchain world, MESG and hal are the main players.

What is our key differentiator?
We focus on people as the first step, so we're working to provide the softest experience, reduce the complexity and allow the users to get the data/info what they want. Also in the long-term we want to decentralize the notifications systems to allow companies/developers to focus more on what it's important and allow the people to get only what is important to them.

Alfred walks people through the steps necessary to create a “crypto will,” provides a consensus algorithm for generating proof-of-death, and enables executors to pay debts and distribute assets to beneficiaries at the click of a button.

Our self-sovereign endowment solution combines an oracle with a live man’s switch to provide a crypto estate management dApp. The oracle monitors electronic death reporting systems (EDRS) while the live man’s switch provides configurable confirmation and contest periods.  

Once proof-of-death is established, Alfred gives the designated executor the power to settle the deceased individual’s outstanding debts and the smart contract distributes their assets to beneficiaries either “as-is” or settled for Ether thanks to our integration with Kyber.

Developed by Ken Hodler, Aaron Anderson, Morgan Sherwood, and Seth Goldfarb, Alfred won a bounty from Kyber Network at ETHDenver 2020 for the integration.

The team incorporated an Aragon DAO as a Wyoming LLC using Etherize in mid-March of 2020 and will continue working to help answer the question: ""what happens to my crypto after I die?""

1262,gaia-gives-web3-philanthropy-for-radical-transpar,"If we’re serious about a regenerative future, philanthropy needs a revolution.

Traditional giving is inefficient, boring, and broken.

Donors:
🧐 Have a hard time finding vetted impact projects.
🔮 Don’t know where their money is spent 
🥱. Rarely get updated on the true impact of their donation.

Impact Projects: 
💰 Spend significantly to find donors.
 📣 Struggle to engage donors.
 📋 Have no clear way to demonstrate their impact.

So we are creating Gaia Gives, a blockchain-based fundraising platform that promotes impact projects, with a radically transparent fundraising engine that enhances storytelling, aids fundraising, and rewards donors for their participation.

Our platform is a complete rethinking of charitable giving, with the goal of turning donors into collaborators to help fuel a regenerative future.



Why Gaia Gives Can Make An Impact:

⛰️ Milestone Based Fundraising - Project goals are broken into achievable milestones with proceeding funds released after successful completion of each step.

🔭 Transparent Budgets and Impact Verification - Projects submit proof for each milestone, and donors collectively verify if the goal was actually accomplished.

🔗 Payments Tracked On Blockchain - Be certain your money is going to the right place with blockchain-powered track and trace payments.

📙 Curated Database of Impact Projects - Projects are verified for impact and fiscal responsibility before listing, and supported with coaching and mentorship once accepted.

🏎️ Donate Cash and Crypto in Seconds - Smoothly create a wallet, allocate, and adjust monthly giving to multiple projects without paying additional gas fees. 

📰 Get News Feed Updates At Every Step - Better stories lead to more donations. We help projects connect directly with their donors through dynamic project updates that easily reformat for social sharing to other platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Tiktok.

⌛ Give Recurring Crypto Donations Without Gas Fees - Accepting 50+ cryptocurrencies and fiat, our wallet manages automated monthly donations and minimizes gas fees letting donors keep full custodianship of their funds.

💸 Built-In Fiat On and Off-Ramping - Accepting fiat and allowing the payment of fiat to 74 countries, an essential feature for less tech-savvy impact projects. 

🙌 Massive Launch Partners - The Ocean Cleanup Project, UNIFY, Viva Con Agua, Surfrider Foundation, and Grassroots Economics to name a few

🪙 Token Economy and Decentralization in 2023 - Tokens reward donors for giving, verifying milestones, and contributing to platform curation Tokens can be staked with projects to earn yield and support their initiative. We aim to gradually decentralize the platform’s governance with token holders providing governance direction.

Fuel Our Future - Why Give?

Until we close our current round of investment, we have little fuel in our tank to help build community and gain early traction. Your support is critical in helping make our vision a reality.

Funds raised via Gitcoin will go towards helping us expand our community and begin preparing the market for our launch in late 2022. 

Who are we?

We're a team of change-makers based in Costa Rica with deep experience in both startups and aid & development. Having launched multimillion-dollar companies, fundraised for some of the world's largest NGOs, and worked directly on the ground as impact projects ourselves, we feel confident that we can grow to meet the challenge and responsibility of such a large undertaking.

3091,blockchain-infrastructure-carbon-offset-working-g,"About Blockchain Infrastructure Carbon Offset Working Group (BICOWG):
The Blockchain Infrastructure Carbon Offset Working Group (BICOWG) is exploring carbon measurement methodologies and proper carbon offset incentivization mechanisms. The working group has designed preliminary drafts for a system designed to incentivize offset of carbon footprint through the use of tokenized carbon credits and integration into existing yield generating opportunities in DeFi and indexes. 

The working group is comprised of strategic members from the carbon markets and blockchain industry including: 
Daniel Hwang (stakefish and F2Pool)
Joseph Pallant (Blockchain for Climate Foundation)
Gregory Landua (Regen Network)
Joshua Bijak (Creol)
Tamlyn Rudolph (Vega Protocol)
Max Roszko, Michael Burgess, Loong Wang (Ren Protocol)
John Lee (SZNS)
Rapha (Toucan Protocol)
Archimedes (KlimaDAO)
Damien (Offsetra)
Michael, Brandon Roth (Fungy Proof)

Why Blockchain Infrastructure Carbon Offset Working Group should receive grant:
We’ve designed a preliminary system that can incentivize carbon credit offset purchases paired with yield generation opportunities. Through the building blocks of DeFi lending protocols, NFT indexing platforms, and curatorial governance, the carbon offset system we’ve designed can address the carbon footprint of blockchains in a robust and resilient manner rather than one-off solutions. We are looking for opportunities to work with stakeholders in the ecosystem to:
Work as Green Packaging Entities that can pair wrapped assets with tokenized carbon credits
Participate in the system we’ve designed as applications
Promote the narrative of supporting greened assets
These grants can help support narrative pushes, education, and integration costs for these systems we’ve designed! 

Rough generalizations for example can paint primary purposes of miner activity as profit generation and the side effects being the decentralized consensus we all enjoy. Therefore, if we can define carbon offset as good behavior, then we must incentivize it.

4142,educationconnect-the-app-that-enables-people-to-t,"What is EducationConnect?

EducationConnect is an open source platform that helps students, professors, institutions, philanthropists and people to protect their intellectual ideas through a decentralized and transparent way using blockchain technology to document each journey from start to finish while protecting its privacy.

The mission of EducationConnect is to enable people to take ownership of their works, projects, and ideas through a representation of NFTs that they can sell, swap or rent. Each idea/project is represented as an NFT that holds a financial value. The way it works is by a simple process where the user shares their awesome idea within our platform, we generate a Non Fungible Token, then the user invites people, mentors, experts and investors, to join his/her project by offering funder benefits and incentives.

 We are providing users with the necessary tools and resources allowing Individual/Institutions to fund student projects for further education and research support. This creates new opportunities for people to secure their work, project, and ideas as an NFT. Please help us to reach our goals by contributing to this project. 


What have we achieved so far without fundings?
We have been working on our free time to develop EducationConnect because we feel that there is no platform currently available that connects investors with otherwise excluded inventors. In less than 3 months we have developed an MVP with the following technologies and features:

Users can browse all projects but only members who purchase the project NFT have access to   full documentation and community
Users can become part of the project
Users can create new projects, edit them and invite people to their projects
Every project has an NFT, description, who is part of the team, project status (updates), milestones and investors  
Institutions, companies and users can contribute or fund a project
Users can donate NFTs to a project 
Contributors can submit new updates and bounties to get pay or credit for their work
A user can interact securely with our Dapp from their desktop computer using Metamask
Currently we are deployed to the Polygon Network 

Why a Gitcoin Grant?
We are using this grant to attempt to partially fund the development of the project. Currently, we are in an early stage of this project and funding an opensource project is not an easy task when we are part time students and workers. Therefore, to continue with this project we need all the help we can get. So far the project is self-funded but we want to improve some existing features and add new ones. Proper funding would allow us to do this as well as buying a custom domain name and a premium server. In the future we would like to implement support for students for their education by offering grants, scholarships and more. As well as, add the ability for users to donate crypto currencies to a project. 
 
Everything we have created is available for the community for open use. This project is for social good and for the improvement of our society by bringing new ideas into fruition.

Hand-washing is crucial to the fight against virus and disease - and it's what we do!

The good news is, for years, as we installed and repaired water points across Africa, we also taught hundreds of schools and communities how to build hand-washing stations, how to keep their water source and homes free of germs, and how to begin other good health practices. It’s what we do every day and it is saving lives. But we need to do more and we need to ensure water keeps flowing throughout the crisis.

Now, more than ever, we urgently need your help to stay on the front lines of this fight, today and into the coming months. While we may not be able to avoid every work shutdown or quarantine along the way, we certainly CAN avoid a financial pause - with your help. When your giving continues, water keeps flowing for children and families who need it most.

For the last few weeks, leading up to the world-wide spread of COVID-19, we’ve been working with our teams at home in the U.S., and in Kenya, Uganda and Sierra Leone to ensure everyone is safe and cared for. We’ve taken specific steps to keep all of our staff and partners protected and we're all working remotely as needed, which is quite normal given our distributed team.

Now - and without interruption - we are doing the most important work we know of to battle back the spread of this virus.

We're longtime friends of the cryptocurrency community and now we need your help more than ever.

1999,agg-a-new-kind-of-stablecoin,"What is a stablecoin?
Aims to minimize volatility.
Is usually relative to a single trusted base currency (like $USD).

DAI, USDC, USDT and other stablecoins are based on the $USD. The value of the $USD is very stable, until it isn’t.

In the war between Ukraine and Russia, we saw their Ruble drop ~66% in 30 days. This could happen to another currency, including USD especially with rising inflation rates and slowing economic activity (possible recession). 



This is evidence that using a single currency as a stablecoin base is not perfect. I propose we define a new kind of aggregated stablecoin that is relative to an emergent and (somewhat) unregulated market, cryptocurrencies.

The idea is to aggregate the value of the top cryptocurrencies (top currencies are defined by their legitimacy and market cap) and average their daily values. For example, let’s use BTC, ETH, and DOGE over 3 imaginary days as our base currencies:

BTC = [$500, $1000, $200]
ETH = [$200, $500, $1000]
DOGE = [$0.1, $0.5, $1]

The Aggregate stablecoin (AGG) would have the following values on the same imaginary days:
AGG = [$233.4, $500.2, $400.3]

If you apply normalization, the numbers become: [$0.33, $0.73, $0.58]

AGG still has large price fluctuations, however it remains more stable than any of the other individual currencies (if you consider percent changes). Stability is enhanced when you add more cryptocurrencies, especially when those currencies are also stable themselves.

I’ve generated what the AGG value graph might look like using the dates 12/1/2018 - 3/9/2022. These graphs were generated using this code. Data was sourced from binance.

Bitcoin’s graph (for baseline):


AGG calculated with 12 hand-picked crypto currencies:



Note: $AGG is expected to move with the signal (wisdom) of the market. If all of crypto goes down, $AGG follows and vice versa. It may not appear stable, but the price of the stablecoin grows with the true value of the aggregated cryptocurrency market and effectively follows macro-movements while ignoring micros.

More techniques we can employ to improve stability:
Multi-day averaging to reduce noise in the time series data (shown in graph as 365 days).
Apply normalization to the prices so as to keep the price low (shown in graph).
Using multiple value-index sources for currencies (aggregating coinmarketcap, coingecko, binance, coinbase, etc.) – furthermore increasing decentralization
Adding a governance system (ie. a DAO) to make the base for AGG forkable.

The grant funding would be used to:
Fund research and development of the coin (EVM based). Due to it being a stablecoin, it can be deployed to EVM compatible chains, ie. ETH, NEAR, SOL, etc as tokens.
Get it listed on major exchanges like coinbase/binance.

Contact tracing applications, offering exposure data management and monitoring tools that allow identification of affected individuals and/or those who have been exposed to individuals with the illness to take preventative measures and self-isolate, are emerging as a critical function of the nascent pandemic response initiatives.

Countries with strong democratic values require voluntary tracing schemes for socio-political acceptance, but risk to data privacy and civil rights present a hurdle to adoption. For contact tracing systems are to offer an effective pathway to prevention they must be widely adopted.

Hello everyone! The BlockCode joins a new funding round to keep growing as a media outlet dedicated to report and investigate the realities of use and development of blockchain-related technologies for our spanish-speaking audience.

Before referring to the progress made thanks to the awesome grant supporters in the last round, let's refresh why we are here:

The Issue: Right now, the vast majority of the current media coverage in crypto is directed to English speakers, excluding Latin American development in the news and shorting the exposure of advances and issues related to the cryptocurrency field in the region. 

How we fix it: The BlockCode serves as a platform for investigative journalism in crypto for spanish speakers and english speakers alike, adding value to the DeFi ecosystem by showing the unexplored edges of financial blockchain-based technologies in Latin America and around the globe .

Our team grew! Welcome our new video editor, Gabriel Godoy (@gabrielgodoy07)
We have successfully produced and published our first mini-travel series, including an investigative report on P2P in Mendoza, Argentina.
Currently (very carefully) choosing our video equipment to begin shooting our next material, coming in Q1 2022.

The goal gets closer everyday. Thank you so much for your support to get there! If you consider to give grants to this project, this is how it will be used moving forward:

Expand our team: Our next hire will be a graphic designer!
Build skills: Part of our grants are being used for strictly educational purposes related to content creation and DeFi courses. - Your grant help us greatly to short the learning curve that holds back many content creators in this space!
Services of web hosting (in construction) and editing licenses.

With Bityond, employers can match external or internal candidates to jobs, manage their organization, projects, jobs, applications, interviews and teams, all in one place. 

Candidates will benefit from better job opportunities, connected to each individual skill-set. 

Both employers and candidates are awarded with Bityond Tokens, BYT, any time an action is taken within the Bityond platform. 

Bityond is the ultimate Cloud SaaS recruitment and talent management engine, implementing an open governance model!

Why Bityond?

Currently there is no platform available on the market with Bityond’s
key features:

Skills matching: all skills available in Bityond have been standardized for an accurate and simple matching process;
Interviews module: Employers can create interviews to easily follow-up with different recruitment processes;
External & Internal recruitment: Employers can chose between open jobs for the entire network (recruitment), or jobs open only to organization members (talent management); 
Reviews done right: Candidates and Employers can review performances only if they’ve participated on the same projects;
Monetary incentive: Bityond Tokens will be given to all users for free, upon completing certain actions.
Utility incentive: Bityond token holders can vote on governance, such as for new developments and features.

Problems in recruitment?

Candidates do not like spam email, neither wasting time looking through job posts. Recruiters often face difficulties when trying to find the right candidate on a timely manner, or when evaluating candidates profiles and skills-sets. 

Another issue is that organizations do not have a single platform to find candidates and, at the same time, to manage employees - which is a bottleneck for efficiency gains on resources allocation. 

Issues can be found for both candidates and employers. 

Candidates:

Looking at each job post is a tiring and long process. Candidates need to open different job posts, check if the role, skills and experience match their skill-set and only afterwards they can apply.
Applying via company websites is not a productive and straightforward process, as different companies use different CV registration portals. More however, information required is often redundant.
Candidates receive too much spam email, not connected to their skill-set which is off-putting. The current approach is to send as many emails to candidates as possible, in order to get as many applications as possible.
There is a lack in transparency for most jobs, as candidates do not receive proper feedback or understand the entire interview process. 
As companies use internal databases to manage candidates most information is out-of-date. This instigates more emails to be sent out to candidates, to keep information regularly updated. 
Most Recruitment platforms focus in tasks and HR only, not paying attention to the link between internal and external recruitment. Bityond provides a central hub, working 24/7 to match all job opportunities to candidates skill-sets. 

Employers

Too much time is wasted by recruiters looking for potential candidates on platforms like LinkedIn (who are very aggressive towards user behavior). Also, recruiters might not find the right candidate immediately as matching is substantially limited. 
The cost of a bad hire can have a significant financial impact on any business, as recruitment costs are quite high, especially in IT, as salaries are higher than most sectors. 
Medium and large companies recruiters and managers can’t always assess all employees skill-set. How can they decide who is the best person for a job, available at a given moment in time within their organization? 
Maintaining candidates information in internal databases requires skills and experience maintenance (data housekeeping), which is usually overlooked. 
Candidates skills improve and change over time, at a much faster pace than recruiters can update CVs. 
Currently no web platform or professional network allows for organizations to recruit both internally and externally (inside the organization or across the entire platform). 
Few platforms allow for transparent reviews, meaning users can review any other user, independently of having actually worked together or not.

The Solution? Bityond

By using Bityond candidates do not need to look for jobs and employers do not need to look for candidates, as the platform finds and selects users to jobs depending on skills and preferences. 

All skill-sets are standardized for an accurate matching system. At the moment of writing, Bityond possesses over 10,000 skills, split between Technology, Business, Creative, Languages, Healthcare, Law and Construction. 

The goal is simple: candidates can only apply to open job opportunities that match one or more skills they possess and employers can only contact and select candidates that match their job requirements. In a sense, Bityond streamlines the process for both employers and candidates. 

Bityond is designed to be flexible and to address the needs of all candidates and employers. With the addition of economic incentives users receive BYT for using the application and can later spend BYT to participate in voting on polls about Bityond’s future developments and features – as we aim to decentralize governance!

Bityond Stack

Bityond 1.0 has been developed in ASP.NET Core 2.0 originally, but recently migrated to ASP.NET Core 3.0, the most recent version released by Microsoft. On the front-end, Bityond uses C# and Angular. Server and database infrastructure are based at Microsoft’s Azure cloud (SQL Server). Bityond is already a member of the Microsoft for Startups network.

Bityond Tokens were built over the Ethereum network (ERC20) and we’re currently looking for side-chain solutions (POA / Loomx / etc) to simplify token payments to users; this is, in order to allow token holders to participate in the overall governance model without the need to pay high gas fees, a potential solution is to use a compatible Ethereum side-chains, which have different validation protocols, like dPOS or pure PoS, rendering each transaction near-free. 

Bityond Token

The Bityond Tokens has an unique value within our community. It serves three
main purposes:

To decentralize Bityond's governance model: token holders participate by voting in polls about new developments, features and add-ons. Any agent who holds tokens can participate in Bityond’s governance.
To grant additional utility to all users: by allowing users to donate tokens in order to help creating new developments and to purchase different subscriptions with Bityond Tokens.
To create better incentives for users: as any token holder will automatically enroll to receive free BYT during yearly airdrops.

As the BYT token serves a utility purpose in Bityond’s governance model, tokens will be distributed for free as users complete certain actions, such as:

Login; 
Creating an Organization (must be an active employer);
Creating a Project (must be an active employer);
Creating a Job (must be an active employer);
Applying to a job;
Getting hired for a job;
Joining an Organization;
Joining a Project;
Giving feedback;
Reviewing a job performance;
Adding at least 6 skills on profiles;
Completing profile > 90%;
Referral of new users (who register a valid profile);
Verifying Skills (when available).

More actions will be added as time goes by. The idea is that all actions taken within the platform will endow a certain number of tokens. Users can later ""burn"" tokens when voting in Bityond updates and features polls, through a Quadratic Voting scheme. Or, instead, users can take out the tokens and exchange them for other cryptocurrencies. 

Tokens belong to users and Bityond won't be able block users from taking tokens out of the platform.

Why funding Bityond?

At the moment of writing, the project has mainly been funded by the founder. During the past 4 years Bityond has acquired around $120,000 in funding through the following mechanisms:

Founder: 95% funding.
ICO: 5% funding.

All team members, with the exception of the founder, are paid to work at Bityond, hence the necessity for continuous funding. Additionally, Bityond will use different funding mechanics such as:

Funding through revenues from subscriptions (employers), 
Funding through a decentralized governance model based on Bityond tokens (employers + candidates),
Funding through an ICO (completed),
Funding through grants (ongoing).

By keeping the project funded through multiple streams, Bityond increases its chances of succeeding. Bityond aims at using funds as follows:

Hire more developers to continuously develop and maintain Bityond tokens and smart-contracts,
Create a proper Marketing team,
Give the core team more financial freedom to hire freelancers for specific jobs,
Have cash flow available for online marketing campaigns,
Invest into growth hacking (social media and ads),
Further develop partnerships with a wider range of universities and,
Further develop partnerships with consultancies, talent management and recruitment companies.

2769,nft-africa-nfts-education-for-local-women-artists,"Overview

The NFT Africa workshop hopes to deliver an NFT education module and produce a final report containing prominent female artists’ snapshot on the emancipation of African female artists, potters, sculptors, painters, ceramists, and photographers, and help the female artists mint their artwork. 

NFT Africa will be a structured three-month online program targeting 300 African women, that offers a robust set of resources for the ladies to transform their artwork into the digital future and scale their business. The first effort will focus on Nigeria, to spark a new wave of creative female artists and ideas into the NFT landscape. The program will assist the ladies through the various stages of minting and selling their digital artwork. To build on the importance of this space the program will also dedicate time to providing an overview of blockchain, Ethereum, and NFT basics.

Impact Assessment
We will measure success and impact in several ways. 
During the development stage, which includes reviews, feedback, mentorship and speaker segments, including online platforms for community building.
The second measure will be assisting more than 40% of the participating female artists to successfully mint their projects on NFT platforms.
The third measure will be sales of their digital artworks. The marketing aspect of the NFT space is a very important avenue that is challenging even for the most experienced creators. 
Finally, the last measure is a huge achievement, because it brings more attention to the workshop and the Nigerian female artists. The females will be able to take their knowledge from the workshop and share it with their community which will spark new Nigerian artists into the possibilities of the adoption of non-fungible token and blockchain technology across the continent.


Background

Moremi is a Yoruba Matriarch and Heroine of today's southwestern Nigeria. She was fabled to have sacrificed her only son, “Oluorogbo” to the river god as a sacrifice for the peace of the people of her kingdom. She remains one of the most celebrated women in Yoruba history.

Just like Moremi, many women in Africa have sacrificed all their lives, passion, and potentials for others while they continue to go through life in grief. We believe many Moremis today have sacrificed their ""only sons"" (art skills) because of societal stereotypes, gender roles, and raising families. Women have sacrificed their ambitions and passion for raising families and children in Africa while abandoning their crafts or even doing it behind the doors. Non Fungible Token is the voice for the dead or dying spirit of Arts and Ethereum is the amplifier.

It has been observed that artists find it hard to make gains from their artworks, even harder for the female folks. The purpose of this proposal is to seek the support of the Ethereum Foundation to fund an NFT education workshop for local female artists in Nigeria on the potential of creating Non-fungible Tokens for their artworks on the Ethereum Blockchain.

The 21st century Moremi’s do not have to live, sacrifice so much and die without any gains like Moremi the Heroine. These 21st century Moremi’s should reap the dividends of their sweats and crafts by learning the potentials of NFTs. Women artists can make a good income from their NFTs created and help other women artists' communities. The project will increase the African users in the Ethereum ecosystem via their creation, management and sale of NFTs.

Challenges:

In executing this project, our most significant obstacle is funding. We expect the program budget to be an estimated $56,927. Included in this budget is allocating funding for the artists to create and fund their Ethereum wallets. Currently, Africans, particularly Nigerians, are focused on using bitcoin for transactions. The NFT space is an avenue to increase Ethereum usage within the continent and grow the ecosystem. 

Another obstacle could be finding an NFT marketplace that will provide easy access for artists in Africa. We are aware that some countries are preventing access to these platforms, though we hope that it will not affect our efforts. We understand that one of the risks that we face is the inaccessibility for some ladies. Due to this issue our pressing need may be technical support to help build out an NFT marketplace.

THE BUILD:
.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.
We are currently improving the UI/UX and adding features. Some of the coolest features (but not all) I will list below:

-Mark points on the map of importance and utility (including NFTs but more on that later)

-Provide descriptions and additional info on a point of interest

-Share your LIVE location only to people you choose in your contacts

-Anchor 3D assets to a 3D GPS location in space and be able to retrieve it

-Augmented-Reality positioning and visuals.

-AND MUCH MORE!



For our next phase, we want to improve the scale and quality of the content as well as provide tools for our users to create their own content. Soon our users will be able to create an entire scope of EXPERIENCE unseen today in either the NFT space nor the Augmented-Reality space.

-You will be able to mint your own Utility-Based NFTs and create geofenced barriers for access.

-You will be able to create and discover AR content and display your current NFTs

At the same time, we will strive to provide a source of side income for our users as we REWARD our users for contributions with our minted ERC-20 tokens that can be exchanged for real money or other cryptocurrencies.

We are building a 3D GPS Utility app that will leverage various Dapps on the Ethereum Blockchain while integrating the new technologies and developments to refine the product. Currently, we are scaling to allow support of over 100k users which will all be saved to the Blockchain AND rewarded with our own minted ERC-20 Tokens.

The tokens are called:

GEMz= Geo-locational, Echo, Map Points on the ""z"" axis.

And we plan to do an ICO within the next month or so.

The Augmented-Reality (AR) platform we are building will allow users an incredible amount of flexibility:

1206,panvala-league-mol-leart,"Mol LeArt is a DAO representing Web3 creative commons, where we create smart NFTs that work for creators. 

Motivation 💡
Humans are creative creatures, we use our brains to dream up fantastical and impossible things. Artists bring these things to life through mediums like paintings, music, writing, and more. Many of our favorite stories and memories are because of art. We love these things so much we’re willing to pay for them, sometimes at tremendous valuations.

The problem is, art has traditionally been guarded by gatekeepers, the middlemen like galleries and brokers which offer little to no transparency when art gets sold and resold. As a result, when art is sold at higher and higher multiples, artists don’t get a piece of those profits. The phrase “starving artist” is a stereotype that is often associated with creatives but it doesn’t have to be this way.

At Mol LeArt, artists are able to tokenize their work and retain a number of controls pertaining to how the token is used, even after it is sold. Our goal is to expand the set of controls available to artists so that they no longer need to rely on third parties to engage in commercial activities. Like putting a pilot in the cockpit with different switches and knobs for controlling the direction of an aircraft, Mol puts the power back in the hands of the artists.

DAO Mechanism ⚙️ 
Value creation at Mol LeArt will be tied to DAO shares. This might look like a fee to use smart contracts developed by Mol LeArt and/or setting the DAO’s guildbank as a recipient of a portion of secondary art sales. More research is needed to determine how this will work, but the initial setup fee seems like the easiest way forward.

Those who create value for Mol LeArt will also receive DAO shares. Anyone can submit a proposal to the DAO offering to do work and requesting the amount of shares they would like in return. The current DAO members can review the request and then approve or deny it.

544,culturestake,"A web-based voting and connection system for decentralised cultural decision-making and investment.

Using a Quadratic Voting (QV) dapp, CultureStake’s playful front-end interface allows everyone to vote on the types of cultural activity they would like to see in their locality.

CultureStake democratises arts commissioning by providing communities in places with a way to make cultural decisions together with artists. It does this by giving communities a bigger say in the activities provided in their area, and by connecting artists and cultural organisations to better information about what is meaningful in different localities.

People vote according to aesthetic power and social and cultural relevance of particular artworks to their localities - in this way they rank how strongly they feel collectively about artworks and the issues they raise. Votes are tracked and made visible, giving evidence of the types of projects communities would most value.

Currently, major artists and cultural sponsors have the upper hand and this can result in one-size-fits-all ‘blockbuster’ programming. CultureStake is a practical response to a growing demand for greater transparency about how, and in whose interest, decisions about the public good are made. It opens the field for experimentation, for robust and sustainable alternatives to centralised and private decision-making practices.

The ultimate vision for CultureStake is that governance and funding of culture are put into the hands of audiences, artists and venues, acting together in and across localities and time. In this way, we hope to increase a shared sense of agency, imagination, and alliances.

CultureStake Pilot at Leeds International Festival 2020

The CultureStake pilot is commissioned by the Leeds International Festival 2020 as part of Furtherfield’s Future Fairness. This is a family-friendly fair of art and technology activities to examine the future of the world we live in, and to invite participants to choose what they want to see in Leeds in the future. They gather scannable stickers for each activity, which act as proof of participation, and enable them to enter the voting booth. Using the CultureStake voting app  250+ people will decide together which artistic project they would like to see commissioned on a larger scale in Leeds. 

Why does CultureStake Use Quadratic Voting and the Blockchain?

Quadratic voting (QV) was developed as an improvement on one-person-one-vote collective decision-making processes. It attempts to address the associated “tyranny of the majority” problems and data loss about voter intentions (so well understood by Post Brexit citizens of the UK). The significance of election and referenda results are dangerously open to interpretation and manipulation by authorities. 

By providing more information QV has the potential to allow communities of people to better understand what vote results say about their values and intentions. 

How Does Quadratic Voting Work?

All participants receive the same limited number of voting credits that they can distribute to express nuanced preferences. For this reason, voters only use their voting credits on things that matter to them. The quadratic system also enables participants to express the intensity of their preferences for all options, but it costs them proportionately (quadratically) more credits to express strong feelings. 

How Does CultureStake Work?

The CultureStake system will store voting data about each artwork on the Ethereum blockchain to guarantee ongoing access to tamper-proof public data. 

CultureStake tests the ability of QV on the blockchain to produce trusted voting data – secure, transparent, and permanent – about culture experienced in places:
creating permanent communally-owned information about what matters to people about the culture that happens in places;
contributing to shared and trustworthy knowledge about collective preferences, attitudes, and values.

CultureStake Innovations

applies the innovation of burner wallets to public voting by generating ephemeral keys from the ""voting booth"", thereby easing the onboarding problem;
relays vote transactions on behalf of voters, so that participants can vote regardless of whether they have ether;
uses a commit-reveal scheme to keep votes secret until the voting period has finalized;
enables non-crypto community to use QV and the blockchain to allocate real world resources;
requires voters to invest energy in evaluating options using a proof-of-participation system;
tests real world dynamics by connecting artists from around the world with otherwise potentially underserved regions and so;
involves wider publics with debates around the value of QV and the blockchain by facilitating voting on things that are important to them in physical space.

3378,bake-my-token-create-your-ethereum-polygon-erc20-,"Hi everyone!

Hope you’re having an amazing day.

My name is Nivesh and I live in India. I have been developing websites and application from last 9 years and now gradually starting to build for Blockchain.

Blockchain has become my favourite technology and I wanted to build something for it. As my first ever live project in this new world, I have created a ERC-20 token creator https://bakemytoken.com that doesn’t need any technical/programming knowledge. You just need to fill some fields and within a few minutes, you can launch your own token. It supports Polygon/Ethereum/Binance Smart Chain

All the tokens you create are automatically verified on the explorers like polygonscan.com / etherscan.com / bscscan.com depending on which blockchain you chose.

All the code of contracts is public and can be read/checked on the explorer and it uses openzeppline libraries which are audited and widely used by so many projects.

Supported blockchains:

1. Ethereum
2. Polygon
3. Binance Smart Chain

2243,q2t-quadratictreasury,"##Intro.
Q2T combines DIDs, Mutual Credit & Quadratic Funding to allow (1) a sybil-resistant, fair mean for donors to support Public Goods - and (2) a way for projects to attract funds and non-repayable loans in a permissionless fashion, based on the milestones achieved.

###Problem(s).
Projects in the area of Public Goods struggle to attract timely funds, needed in order to bring innovation openly, limiting the rate of abandonment (unsustainability) and delays (lack of resources). They either have to wait for lengthy local/governmental procedures (for grants), or rely on public donations, that may be unpredictable, and too tightly bounded to (often unviable practices such as) Marketing & Advertisement.

Gitcoin was one of the 1st successful experiments of Quadratic Funding, and their platform was able to attract a wopping 1M+ USD in donations, distributing them to public grants. Nonetheless, with the growth of the platform and the increase in the amount of projects, issues such as sybil-attacks (to achieve matching pool manipulation) and ""popularity games"" (where the grant position and the popularity of a project determine their success in directing donations) started to become more and more influential, and harder to overcome.

###Solution.
Quadratic Treasury leverages on AAVE Native Credit Delegation & on a Mutual Credit system (DistributedTown) to offer a solution to these problems, by (1) letting Public Goods donors and supporters donate directly in a specific area of Public Goods (currently: Blockchain/Open-source; Art&Events; Local Communities), and (2) by using a 2-step quadratic distribution to match this area-specific pool of funds with the public projects that achieved the highest amount of milestones in that given range of time. It also uses (i.) a Mutual Credit system that works as an internal ""score"" for DAOs & Communities, and (ii.) a unique, universal Identity layer (DID) based on Skills & Contributions, rather than personal data. Making it sybil-resistant and 100% pseudonymous by design.

2980,bondablexyz-web3-recruitment,"I have been toying with an idea around a job board for Gitcoin. 

There is so much hiring happening in web3 lately that everyone is reaching out to everyone in hopes of finding a dev, yet there is no incentive to do the leg work to find qualified candidates. 

I propose a system I call ""Bondable"".

Bondable is a tripple sided, Job's Marketplace, Recruiter, Talent, Employer. 

## How it works

Employer Posts a Job and bonds to that job some GTC as a reward for whoever recruits the talent for the position. 

Recruiter(anyone) finds talent that they believe would best fill that role, and bonds to them a nominal sum for a period of time chose by the recruiter.

The recruitment bond is a a signalling mechanism that allows for me the recruiter to showcase my valuable talent up front, as a means to indicate what I believe their level of employability is.

Example: Alice bonds 100 GTC to Bob for 14 days, indicating she believes that Bob is quality asset and is in her mind, easily hireable in 14 days. 

The 100 GTC Alice bonds to Bob is not at risk, it is merely encumbered until one of two things happen, Bob is hired, or the 14 days has expired, with a stream starting 50% of the way through the bonding time. 

If bob is hired, Alice's bond is released immediately along with a two part reward. 

If bob is not hired by the end of Alice’s duration set her entire bond is unencumbered and can be withdrawn. 

Part 1 is the finders fee, Alice claims this immediately once the listing is closed. (nominal fee)

Part 2 is the recruitment fee that is paid out over the course of the reward setting created by the Employer on listing, some % of the salary with a cliff before streaming starts.

We have made a lot more progress, 60,000+ Kenyans from vulnerable communities have moved over $3 Million through the Sarafu network this year alone!

We are working to support dozens of blockchain-based Community Inclusion Currencies (CICs), to give aid directly to Kenyans and enable them to create their own sustainable economies. Currently people can use the system with feature phones with USSD.  We are also working to make these systems available all over the world. While the system already live (on a shoe string), there is still a mountain to climb technically and we need all hands on deck!

What we're working on:
Hardening backed systems - USSD (so people can access ledgers without internet)
Education materials and systems modelling
Smart contract upgrades and deployment 
User generated CIC token interface 
Web based wallet as well as marketplaces and a donor gateways.

We have an incredible team of great devs, writers and community organizers assembled and they are willing to be paid part time to pay the rent and put in a ton of volunteer time. 

Donations to this Gitcoin Grant will be used to support this wonderful team and the communities in Kenya and around the world we are empowering.

Current Statistics: 

This year we tracked roughly $3 Million USD worth of transactions among over 55,000 Sarafu users in what is currently the worst economic period in history.

Advance the development of the Locha Mesh open-source software and hardware (https://github.com/btcven/locha) to enable private censorship-resistant communications, payments, and dApps without Internet, over a resilient decentralized mesh network using long-range radio.
 
How does the Locha Mesh help the Ethereum ecosystem?
 
We’re developing the open-source software that will run on the devices, the protocol, and the first mobile app to run on Locha Mesh. 
 
We are also creating open-source hardware and guides for making DIY versions of it from off the shelf parts. You can find the guides and other documentation here.
 
In the Locha Mesh anyone will be able to transmit data securely and privately, this will enable an alternative communication channel for syncing your MetaMask wallet, connecting to websites, using dApps, synchronizing and accessing IPFS content, etc; without having to rely on the traditional Internet infrastructure.
 
You’ll be able to run any kind of service that currently works through the traditional Internet thanks to the support of IPv6 within the mesh.
 
We are creating a real high-bandwidth open mesh network, using license-free bands, that is capable of handling not only chats and cryptocurrencies transactions, but also data transmission for full-nodes sync support for DAppNode and others.
 
 
What we need
 
We need to hire at least one more core developer (C)
We need to hire one more mobile app developer (React Native, Android, iOS)
We need a technical content manager who can create and keep updated the documentation and tutorials for the community
We need funds to continue paying our full-time developers who are creating the software.
 
 
Milestones
What we can do in the next few months if the community support us through this grant:
 
Improve documentation for developers who want to contribute to Locha Mesh code
Improve documentation on how to build a DIY version of the Locha Mesh devices for developers to join our efforts
Create and open-source the needed materials for assembling DIY versions of the hardware from off the shelf parts
 
 
Future Roadmap
What we will be able to research and create in the near future if we get enough support to advance the Locha Mesh project to a production-ready deployment:
 
Access IPFS content through the Locha Mesh without Internet access 
Syncing a MetaMask wallet through the Locha Mesh
Research on making an Ethereum transaction offline and broadcast it through the Locha Mesh

Use the minimal but powerful uploader (file picker or drag&drop) for uploading and sharing one or multiple files with a single link or QR code.

Uploaded files are encrypted using the sodium crypto library compiled to WebAssembly and pure JavaScript: no one can access them without your permission. Only by sharing the bucket link, other people can download and decrypt the content you uploaded. In addition, by sharing a draft, people can continue uploading more data into the same bucket. Be careful when you share a draft!

SkyTransfer supports uploading entire directories. Last but not least, using MySky you can access buckets, SkyTransfer’s most advanced feature. Buckets are like folders in which files are stored. Before a collection of files can be uploaded, a bucket must first be created.

We are currently working on:

4047,lifespan-extension-by-claritin,"Developing a drug to extend human lifespan requires a drug that is extremely safe when taken over a long period of time. The only drugs for which such data exist are drugs currently approved for human use. Our lab has screened over 95,000 compounds for those that extend lifespan in C. elegans (REFs) including a large fraction of all FDA approved compounds. Analysis of the over 100 hits with regards to the safety profile in humans we identified two anti-histamines Loratadine and Cyproheptadine.

Loratadine, sold under the brand name Claritin, is an antihistamine that is taken by thousands of people in the US for decades. It has an extremely good safety profile. Cyproheptadine is less commonly used, is structurally related to Loratadine, but crosses the blood brain barrier, which Loratadine does not. The reason to believe that these drugs may extend lifespan not only in C. elegans but also in humans is that they are both structurally related to Lonafarnib. Lonafarnib is the first drug approved for the treatment of Hutchinson Gilford Progeria, an accelerated aging disease. 

Cyproheptadine, Loratadine and Lonafarnib all extend lifespan in C. elegans consistent with their structural relationship. Finding that Loratadine/ Claritin extends lifespan in mammals would be an enormous step forward in the treatment of aging in humans. In this application we propose to test these two antihistamines for their ability to extend lifespan in wild type mice. Loratadine is expected to slow peripheral aging, as it does not enter the brain while cyproheptadine is also expected to slow cognitive aging.

We are excited to participate in Gitcoin Round 13.

Introduction
Pine Finance is a protocol for automated and decentralized orders exchange powered by Ethereum.
Limit orders give traders complete control over the rate at which their orders will be executed, enabling traders to automate transactions at a specific rate.
It continues the base commitment to free and decentralized exchange.
Every token combination is available. There isn't a limitation on how you can select what to buy and what to sell (Of course if it is a token living on the Ethereum network).
An order at Pine Finance can only be canceled by its creator, and it can be executed if the creator receives the desired amount, making the system trustless and independent of a central entity.
The smart contract is validated and can be reviewed by anyone. The code hasn't been audited by a reputable third party yet, and we advise to proceed with caution.
More info of how it works

Interaction and order fulfillment example
Imagine the current rate of DAI -> ETH is 0.003. So, based on the market price if the user trades 400 DAI will receive 1.2 ETH. BUT, a user wants to sell 400 DAI in exchange for 1.6 ETH (desired_output).
The user creates a limit order at pine.finance by sending a transaction with the following values:
Input: 400 DAI
Rate: 0.004 DAI-ETH
Output: 1.6 ETH
Once the transaction is confirmed, relayers will start checking if the order can be fulfilled. Reyalers can have their own strategy on how to execute an order. Pine, has a minimum of two relayers running 24/7 with a basic strategy.
The first thing they do is to check how much output, in this case ETH, they will get in exchange for 400 DAI (trade_output). Then, if it is higher or equal than 1.6 ETH (which is what the user set as the minimum output) they check how much will cost to send the transaction to do the trade (execution cost). Once relayers get the execution_cost, they check if they can still achieve the output defined by the user:
desired_output <= (trade_output - execution_cost)
execution_cost depends on the Gas Price. Higher gas prices, higher execution_cost. You can read more about Gas Price here.
Finally, relayers can charge a fee for executing the order (relayer_fee). The final formula will be:
desired_output <= (trade_output - execution_cost - relayer_fee)
Even the math can match, have in mind that if the amount to trade is high, a price impact will occur depending on the liquidity of the pool used.
To continue with real numbers, if the execution_cost is 0.04 ETH and the relayers_fee is 0.006:
1.6 ETH <= trade_output - 0.04 ETH - 0.006 ETH

1.6 ETH <= trade_output - 0.046 ETH

1.6 ETH + 0.046 ETH <= trade_output

1.646 ETH <= trade_output // Final rate 0.004115 for execution

931,yieldhero,"WHAT IS YIELDHERO?
YieldHero, as the name implies, lets you Save the World using just your yield. Powered by Aave, YieldHero gives you the superpower to easily redirect your Aave yield to financially support individuals and groups that you care about, in a totally loss-less manner.
 
If you've ever wanted to fund individuals or groups but don't want to actually shell out your precious ETH, DAI, or other tokens, YieldHero is the perfect choice!
 
THE STORY OF YIELDHERO
Born from the ETHGlobal #HackMoney Hackathon, YieldHero earned second place in the Aave Challenge category. Since its inception, over 50 ETH worth of collateral has been pledged towards YieldHero recipients, including open-source developers and the Gitcoin Crypto for Black Lives grant.
 
WHY A GITCOIN GRANT?
I (Daniel, @coderdannn) would like to continue development on YieldHero, but I need your help! As YieldHero is an open-sourced public good, I do not anticipate making any money from the site. However, loss-less donation is such a powerful tool, that I would really love to continue building out YieldHero into a robust, fully-featured loss-less donation site on Ethereum.
 
I do not see YieldHero as a competitor to Gitcoin. On the contrary, there are exciting synergies that have already begun emerging between the two platforms. As of today, more than 50 ETH of collateral has been pledged towards the Gitcoin for Black Lives grant.
 
HOW WILL FUNDS BE USED?
Funds will primarily be used to pay for my (coderdan's) development time. If a significant amount (more than 2000 DAI) is raised, I will also allocate some funds to paying a professional designer to give the site a UI makeover.
 
Planned features include:
Personal profiles for recipients and donors to show off how generous you are!
Sorting recipients into categories, such as  Open-source developers, Communities, Charity, etc. 
A dashboard for managing who is receiving your yield, and displaying how much yield you have already contributed.
And much more! YieldHero is still very new and is always looking for great ideas. 
 
All funds raised will be converted to aDAI (or another higher-yielding aToken) and the interest will be redirected to other open-source developers via YieldHero.
 
ABOUT CODERDAN

I am a recently graduated MS in Computer Science student at Portland State University. During my time here, I have conducted research in Blockchain, specifically Smart Contract analysis on the Ethereum network. Out of my research I have proposed and made a Smart Contract Registry containing vulnerable contracts, located at https://www.haveibeenexploited.com (try 0xfee8349E613b7d3b00b4C6f6Fe823c0Df39DB1C4 in the search bar to see results). A slide deck of my research can be found here: https://www.slideshare.net/DanielConnelly15/daniel-connelly-ethereum-smart-contract-masters-thesis. 

I will update here with a link to the paper I wrote on this research when it is published. Currently, I have ~800,000 vulnerable contracts in my database by scanning ~1.7 million contract addresses.

Purpose
My purpose is to finish analysis with Mythril, expand my research using other tools, and update the existing website. To finish and expand my research, I am receiving a grant for a high-end computer consisting of 16-cores to last me 8-9 years. The money provided here would be for maintenance of that machine as well as future costs for buying Pro plans of some symbolic execution engines (e.g., MythX) and sharing the results of that. If you have a key of an engine you would like to include, please contact me directly.

470,staking-library,"
Why This Grant

Staking is becoming an important part of the DeFi ecosystem, as a solidity security auditor I came across many projects suffering to implement reliable staking algorithms that suite their needs for an optimized platform, they mainly face a trade-off between complexity and gas consumption.

In this purpose, the creation of a widely used library that can benefit the Ethereum ecosystem is a necessity. Numerous existing and under development projects will be able to rely on to build their platform.

The Problem

In most developed staking contract, user actions have to be saved to compute a staking score or reward, such contract requires high gas usage while making the developers restrict their own Dapps to avoid reaching gas block limits or more commonly an out of gas.

The Goal

This grant aims to solve this problem through the implementation a Dynamic Staking Algorithm, this proposal minimizes gas consumption without imposing any restriction to user actions. Please refer to the following document link for a full algorithm description:
 Dynamic Staking Algorithm

However, more research in coordination with different projects is needed to develop a broader library and possibly propose a new ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) like EIP-900 . 

Some DSA use cases can be found below: 

Future PoS pool design, where stakers will be able to make multiple deposits without any restriction.
A lending platform that distributes dividends to its liquidity providers.
Inflationary tokens using DSA will be able to distribute minted tokens to their stakers following a defined monetary policy.

Beta Results

A beta implementation (contracts and tests included) that simulate a single use case can be found in the following github repository:

Project Repository

All performed tests were successful as per table 2.1 of the proposal, note that this is just the beginning a lot more is yet to come :).

Why do we need funding ?

Running bounties, for some help with smart contracts development ...
Security audits.
Documentation & API creation.
Website to promote the library, and why not a third party staking platform where projects will just plug and play.
Buy a cup of coffee ;)

All kinds of contributions are welcome (financial, ideas or PRs) especially the most expensive ones (which are ideas of course :p) to maintain and create a powerful library. Feel free to comment, propose or create issues or PRs at will.

891,the-genesis-dao,"“The Genesis DAO is DAOstack’s public-goods engine, aiming to develop and expand the DAOstack ecosystem for the good of the entire DAO space.” Ezra Weller

Until late 2019, the Genesis DAO was funded by DAOstack LTD for testing of its DAO interface Alchemy, of the Holographic Consensus framework, and of experimental areas of DAO governance as well as activities around technical development, research, and evangelism of the DAO stack. 

At the end of 2019, the resignation of DAOstack’s Genesis community facilitation team coincided with significant fragmentation of Genesis DAO community into a decentralized community of specialized DAOs bringing about a period of recess for this historically significant, but no longer funded local commons.  

It has been posited that Genesians were only active when Genesis had steady funding and that without funding Genesis is no longer relevant. Yet, as new DAOs spring up on Alchemy the founding aspiration of expanding the ecosystem for the good of the entire DAO space has not faded. This task has not become any less trivial and Genessians have not become any less ambitious, driven or knowledgeable. The writer believes the community has matured, gotten stronger and has a lot of work ahead of it.

Along with DAOstack LTD and the Genesis DAO, bitfwd community seeks to sponsor a program of work with a view to re-establish, organize and re-vitalize Genesis DAO’s landmark qualities of an on-boarding beacon, safe space, ideas incubator, open society forum and community hub where DAOs get nurtured and where DAOists old and new find opportunities learn, grow and make a difference.

We want to create a constructive environment where blockchain community development and governance can be learned by doing and where shared purpose and collective intelligence of new and seasoned DAOists alike continue the work of experimentation and co-creation of thriving decentralized communities. 

It's time for this once buoyant and active community to find new vitality, new ways of raising funds, exciting experiments to play with and significant goals to accomplish.

The proceeds of this grant will go directly to Genesis DAO and ideally mark the beginning of a revitalization movement that will continue on into the future!

Do you remember to keep donating regularly? Do you feel the generic ""thank you"" email is sufficient acknowledgement (personally and publicly)?)

Wildcards connects endangered animal conservations and donator's directly through a fun and engaging platform via a recurring revenue model. 

Donators purchase digital endangered animals that are verifiably unique by the blockchain which are always for sale this means that when a user purchases a wildcard they are instantly required to set a selling price.

The owner is incentivised not to raise the price too high because they pay a percentage of their sale price to hold the animal, and these funds are continually generated for endangered animal conservation.

Wildcards is the first (and only?) scalable Harberger tax system deployed on mainnet ethereum. Scalable in the sense that a smartcontract manages the multiple NFTs and so users can own and pay for multiple tokens with the same deposit shared between them. And thus Wildcards can be thought of as the first ""patronage market"" on Ethereum.

It is not based on the extractive attention economy, so no polarizing content is simply promoted to gain some add clicks and keep the user connected.

Many social networks are full of irrespective, unproductive and damaging content. Although they usually ban the most extreme expressions, the slightly less extreme get promoted and thus polarizes our society with lies and hate.

Here, in Open Social Network, we want to make an alternative. A digital social network just as our physical society is: imperfect, but without a magnifying glass on our imperfections.

Of course, it may be a bit more boring than its alternatives. If you have a walk around your city, town or community, you may or may not find people talking. Their conversations may or may not be interesting. And, from time to time, you may come across a quarrel. But what you will not find is everyone shouting to each other at the same time, without listening at any moment to what the other has to say.

The centralization of the web into the hands of a few tech giants threatens the freedom and individuals and the survival of democracy. LeapDAO seeks to sustainably decentralize power by enabling web-citizens to own their data and communities to flourish and govern themselves by providing them with scalable decentralized applications.

How?
sponsorship will help us to deliver solutions that enable a more decentralized web:
decentralized apps - seamless user experience enables frictionless on-boarding.
sovereignty - custom gas economies shielding your transactions from fluctuation of the base layer.
scalability - rollups and state channels giving your applications virtually unlimited throughput.

History
Project delivering decentralized applications powered by LeapDAO:

SunDAI was a pop-up economy running on the Leap Network connected to the Ethereum mainnet DAI contract.
[Planet A](https://leapdao.org/blog/Planet-A-ccc-ethberlin-recap/) is a serious social game created by [Social Dist0rtion Protocol](https://github.com/social-dist0rtion-protocol) and played at CCcamp and Ethberlin on the Leap Testnet.
Volt Congress is a pop-up democracy event held by [Deora](http://deora.earth) using Plasma Leap for quadratic voting.
Together with other layer-2 projects we have finalized ERC 1948, which enables data to migrate accross chains wrapped as non-fungible tokens.

White Rabbit is managing movie-rights on-chain. 
> LeapDAO's past achievements with the Ethereum ecosystem delivers scalability for micro-transactions. This is vital for White Rabbit's mission of peer-to-peer distribution and transactions for films. Along with our investors, prominent Oscar and Cannes winning producers, we have the utmost faith in the team at LeapDAO to deliver a blockchain that empowers an independent film industry.

1361,mediadao,"⏳Background
Media as we know it is dying. In multiple cities in the world, we are seeing an increase in the creation of cooperative structure and business models around media. This is a moment of opportunity to bring DAO frameworks and business models
to the sector, and in so doing, better shore up the social and democratic role of the media through a business model based on using commercial success to provide social benefit.

🎙What is MediaDAO?
MediaDAO is an idea that was born out of the need of creating new types of global media facilitated by open source software. We want to connect individuals and organizations that are passionate about media with those interested in consuming it at the local and global level. We want to create a world where the media that we consume is more resilient to the influence of power structures.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦Who are we?
We are a group of media enthusiasts that has been thinking about the different structures that could be used for having an organic organization that focuses on communicating, it was started by ManuAlzuru (Entrepreneur focused in social impact), Joan Riera (founder and CEO of the largest network of media for millennials in Spain and Latin America, Codigo Nuevo) and members of the EmpanaDAO.

💸Why Gitcoin Grants?
We want to focus the next 3 months in designing the token economics and governance model for this DAO and sub DAOs.


👁Who are we looking for?
MediaDAO collective is looking for problem solvers, community organizers, makers, designers, creators, artists, web3 engineers, token engineers, game developers, documenters, game theory experts, educators, journalists and anyone who believes that could contribute to the creation of a community owned media.

🔜What's next for MediaDAO?
We want to create a sustainable organization with a decentralized infrastructure in order to minimize the single points of failure that we currently have. 
🔹Create the token economics and governance model for the organization.
🔹Recruit independent journalists that want to be part of a larger organization.
🔹Launch our pilot supported by Codigo Nuevo.

3075,blockchain-visual-analyzer-follow-the-tokens,"What address caused those big green and red candles? Chain analysis allows to ""follow the tokens"" as they get transferred and swapped in the Ethereum blockchain. This kind of intelligence is becoming more and more important as businesses launch new tokens, and proceed with the tokenization of assets.

When it's time to evaluate the fundamentals of a blockchain project or a token, it's never that easy to answer the following questions:

1) what and how many addresses hold most of the tokens?
 
2) are there any whale addresses and if so, how many?

3) is the token well distributed or centralized?

4) is there any multi-signature safe holding most of the treasury?

5) looking at the DEX, what address caused those red and green candles?

6) how many addresses are operating on the DEX market?

The above are just some of the many questions that a Blockchain Visual Analyzer could answer in a glance. Having visualization of number of addresses, holded tokens, volumes swapped and so on, would allow a clear picture of how the market is moving on Decentralized Exchanges.

What is the project's status?
We are currently extracting data from the blockchain, elaborating it in order to understand what are the most useful views and aggregate that we will need in the Blockchain Visual Analyzer.

Why do we need funding and devs?
We need to fund the R&D of this project, with the goal of having a complete web based front end. In this, it will be possible to plug any Ethereum based token address, to see its history and metrics in a few clicks.

ETHLocal contributes to a “local adoption” pace to crypto, by breaking the “mass adoption” agenda into smaller use cases that can feed into pre-existing and self-sustainable social innovation environments.
 
We are starting with the following, ambitious projects:
-Hackathons with a local and sustainable twist in medium to small cities (ETHTurin in April 2020, ETHBolo(gna) in 2021, and more to be announced)
-A partnership with DFOHub to structure ETHLocal and the related activities without owners, but not without governance
-A growing network of crypto-friendly accommodations and co-working spaces (that we call citadels) with a focus on sustainability. Some will be managed directly by ETHLocal and some existing ones will be in the ETHLocal network/franchise.
-Micro-financing, consulting and governance solutions offered to grassroots projects (urban gardens, permaculture, agro-tourism, art residencies, local citizen currencies)
 
For more details, read our manifesto on Medium.

 It's an open borderless community to empower Arabs in blockchain technology. Our main goal is to build a strong supportive community and explain blockchain to Arabs in their own language 
( Arabic) to facilitate the know-how transfer and eliminate the language barrier. We aim to connect the global and the local community in Blockchain.

Problem 
 According to Wikipedia, Arabic is one of the five most spoken languages in the world ( Arabic and its different dialects are spoken by around 422 million speakers). The Arab countries are 22 countries talking the same language “ with different dialects” with a population of 423 million !!! 
The Arab countries are youth countries with a diversity of resources, and by looking at the blockchain adoption you can see a variant level of adoption;  UAE is one of the early adopters and is considered a worldwide crypto hub. While many others are way slow to adopt. Gulf countries are more into investing in blockchain projects while  Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordon, and other countries have IT-skilled youth. The lack of blockchain active communities that really support and increase the blockchain awareness with no language barriers in the Arab region is one of the main challenges that we face. 


Challenges that Face Arab Ecosystem 
The blockchain technology in the MENA region is in its early stage
Awareness about the Blockchain Business Opportunities
Accessing technical and business knowhow 
Finding good talent 
Obtaining knowledge 
Accessing Funding 
Accessing curated tools & services

ETH Dev Tools is ready for usage and we hope you'll take a look and try it out. Feel free to leave feedback, comments or contributions here or on the Github Issues.

Github: https://github.com/EthDevTools/ethdevtools

ETH Dev Tools is a chrome developer tools extension that acts like a swiss-army knife for dapp developers and curious users.

We created this and won at ETHDenver last year, and are now looking for further funding to turn it into something real that devs can start using during their daily work!

Check out https://ethdevtools.xyz/ for a preview of how it will look!

The funding will be used to revive the project, get it production ready and working with the latest solidity versions and web3 conventions, polishing it off to provide a great dev UX, and then extending it with additional modularity and new modules!

The original hackathon project appears in a chrome inspector tab and comes with various modules that introspect the current dapp you're using. The plugin will be easily extensible for additional tools and is planned to come with 3 fully functional modules:

Logs — A network inspector that shows logs and details of all network interactions between your dapp and your RPC endpoint via the web3.js provider including request timing, parameter inputs and return values.

ABI Explorer — This section keeps a list of all contracts the dapp has loaded and scaffolds boilerplate forms based on the ABIs of those contracts. The autogenerated UI gives you access to all contract methods ready to be queried with calls and sends—similar to what's possible with Remix or a verified contract on Etherscan, but without the context switching or compilation.

GraphQL Explorers — A GraphQL explorer that comes pre-populated with Infura's EthQL endpoints as well as all of the most popular The Graph subgraphs including Uniswap, ENS, Dharma and others. These endpoints come with sample queries ready to ping all the most relevant and highly available content. There's also the option to add a custom endpoint for easy access to any other available datasets.

ETHDevtools also received a Grant from Consensys to help with development. A retrospective of our grant can be seen here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WlmVBMuKH4ph-aX9SLzSHOgnFNi4IZuSvU7lTRDNohA/edit?usp=sharing

1240,trickle-your-hourly-pay-cryptographically-secured,"The internet era brought a lot of new good things as well as real challenges. Esports, decentralized communities, freelance, whatever. Making a monetary agreement over the internet is a common practice today, however, there are more and more cases when people are fooled and are just not getting paid.

Trickle is a complete application that allows people to create hourly-rate-driven contracts between multiple parties in any ERC20-compatible tokens or stablecoins. It implements the most transparent monetary relationships between the customer and contractors (employer/employees, teams/players and so on).

-	From the contractor's side, the agreement is 100% safe as tokens accrued to their balance are permanent. If the employer decides to cancel the agreement, the contractor just stops providing services, without losing a thing.
-	From the employer's side, the employer doesn't lose too much when they get a bad contractor. It's the employer's responsibility to check how well the contractor is doing. And they can cancel the agreement at any time for a reason.

For example, when you are a contractor with an hourly rate of $20, you can withdraw your funds at any time: $1 after 3 minutes, or $10 after half of an hour, or $200 after 10 hours. Before the agreement is established, the employer determines the period of an agreement, and the tokens are locked on the smart contract. Later, the smart contract releases tokens to the employee according to their hourly rate.

However, both the sender and the recipient have the ability to terminate the agreement. The key point is that in the case of agreement termination, the recipient receives tokens/stablecoins that have accrued on their balance up until the termination date, according to their fixed-hourly rate. Thus:

- 	From the recipient’s side, they are secure because blockchain guarantees they will receive the tokens/stablecoins which have accrued to date. In the case the sender spontaneously decides to terminate the agreement, the recipient just stops providing services with no losses.
-	From the sender’s side, they don’t have the risk of paying a dishonest recipient; it’s the sender’s (employer’s) responsibility to check how well the recipient (employee) performs, and in case of a bad performance, the agreement can be terminated at any point.

These two points are crucial. We believe that this is the only true transparent model for over-the-internet or untrusted financial relationships, which doesn’t require the involvement of third parties.
 
What's Next for Trickle?
Automated notifications for agreements (email and messengers), different types of agreements, recurring agreements and many more. Contributions to this grant is appreciated, thank you Gitcoin community.

3670,janusxr,"JanusXR re-imagines webpages as collaborative 3D webspaces interconnected by portals. It's a looking glass to the entire existing Internet infrastructure as a content base: every website is a multi-user 3D environment you can portal into.

To be precise about the meaning of the name Janus - it is in reference to the portals which are used to interconnect rooms. Like the Roman god Janus, a portal is a single object with two faces that can peer into two separate spaces.

We are an open source community project passionate about the decentralized metaverse. We're working on an easy to use framework to make the web more 3D. Building an immersive social network is just one use-case, it's a pretty general system that can be used as a drop-in programmable 3D render view for your data. Out of the box you get custom avatars, voice and video communication, positional audio, scripting, physics, real-time collaborative editing, and VR/AR support through WebXR.

The Janus client supports markup so its easy to read/write and deploy anywhere you would normally host a static website. Anything you create exists on the domain of your choice, we exert no control over the content its users create, as it would be impossible to regulate the internet in such a way. Even the presence server is open source and can be easily self hosted.

Features:
- open source: https://github.com/jbaicoianu/janusweb
- build 3D with HTML / JS, rendering via Three.js / webGL
- custom avatars and worlds
- desktop + headset support via webxr
- no downloads, runs in browser
- open standards / file formats (#glTF)
- text + voice chat (spatial audio)

3335,ruby-cryptographic-infrastructure-for-data-moneti,"Ruby is Building a Cross-chain Cryptographic Infrastructure for Data Monetization

Ruby Protocol is the Privacy-centric Data Monetization Framework for DeFi and Web3.0 Powered by Polkadot. It is a data monetization framework based on functional encryption. It designs and implements a fine-grained data monetization framework serving as a privacy layer interacting with smart contract platforms. It enables end-to-end encrypted data monetization on public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Polkadot) and decentralized data solutions (e.g. IPFS).

Platform Pillars
Decentralized Data Monetization Framework serves as a second-layer/middleware protocol interacting with the substrate module. The framework will enable a data owner to enforce a fine-grained access control policy over the encrypted private data using functional encryption.

Decentralized Data Cloud Platform which is a decentralized and open platform for personal or private data exchange and pricing. Users can share predefined computation results over the private data with a data purchaser in exchange for economic compensation.

Core Components
Ruby Protocol will implement a second-layer/middleware protocol running on Polkadot that enables individuals to monetize their private data in a fine-grained fashion. The delivery will include four core components:
Ruby Cryptographic Library that implements the inner product functional encryption and quadratic polynomial functional encryption.
Ruby Substrate Module that implements the encryption of the cryptographic keys of the functional encryption scheme and the associated zero-knowledge proof for its legitimacy.
Ruby Micropayment Scheme running on the Polkadot blockchain can allow individual users to monetize their data.
Ruby Token $RUBY is the native token of Ruby Protocol which will play the role of governance and utilities. $RUBY plays the key role to secure network decentralization.
The access control policy will be built into the substrate module, and the data monetization transaction will also execute via substrate module, which is why this solution is defined as a second-layer/middleware protocol.

Key Features
The framework will enable a data owner to enforce a fine-grained access control policy over encrypted private data using functional encryption, and share predefined computation results over the private data with a data purchaser in exchange for economic compensation.
True Interoperability: Ruby is specifically built for the Polkadot ecosystem focusing on data monetization based on functional encryption.
Attribute-based Encryption: The core cryptographic technology Ruby adopts is attribute-based encryption, which is specifically designed for fine-grained access control.
Zkp and Micropayment: Ruby employs the zkp and micropayment schemes in our system architecture to build a data monetization framework derived from fine-grained access control.
Community-driven Governance: Ruby applies a sophisticated governance system where all stakeholders have a voice. Token holders are able to vote for the protocol upgrades and parameter changes.
Multiple Use Cases: Ruby can be implemented in different industries, including finance, health care, cloud computing and supply chain, etc.
Security and Decentralization: Ruby operators are themselves stakers and validators in a NPoS system of Ruby Protocol in the future.

Substrate/Polkadot Integration
We will leverage the existing cryptographic library in the Polkadot ecosystem, such as ZeroPool to build the underlying cryptographic library that implements the zero-knowledge proof for the legitimacy of the encrypted functional key. We will also integrate the existing inner product functional encryption and quadratic polynomial functional encryption with the Polkadot ecosystem. Furthermore, we will also build a substrate pallet that integrates the verification logic of the associated zero-knowledge proof and provide the necessary UI for the users to interact with all these algorithms and invoke the aforementioned cryptographic modules and the micropayment scheme.

Competitive Edges
Data privacy is always high on the agenda when it comes to the Crypto community. Since 2015, different projects have been working to improve that on three directions:
Anonymous currency, represented by Zcash, Monero, etc. They mainly meet the needs of anonymous payment.
The privacy projects for crypto payment and transaction, represented by Tornado, zkSync, Starkware, Raze Network, etc. They mainly meet the privacy needs of smart contracts.
Data-based privacy computing projects, represented by Ruby Network, Oasis, and PlatON. They mainly meet the privacy computing needs of the data transaction market.

Milestone 1 — Implement Cryptographic Modules
The main deliverable of this milestone includes: A cryptographic library written in Rust that implements the inner product functional encryption and quadratic polynomial functional encryption. A substrate pallet that integrates the verification logic of the associated zero-knowledge proof for the legitimacy of the encrypted functional key.

Milestone 2 — Client Implementation and Integration
The main deliverable of the milestone is the client that can trigger the aforementioned cryptographic modules and the micropayment scheme and the necessary UI to enable the users to interact with all these algorithms.

227,blockspy-metamask-security-plugin,"Just 2 months ago, the most-popular cryptocurrency wallet for Ethereum & ERC-20 tokens, MetaMask, announced support for third-party plugins. Their hope is to allow third-party developers to extend the functionality & security of MetaMask in their own creative ways. We were thrilled to hear this, so we connected with their devs and got to coding right away. Soon, BlockSpy was born.

What Is BlockSpy?

BlockSpy is a plugin/extension for MetaMask that protects you from 2,900+ different cryptocurrency scams by alerting you when you a recipient’s address has been reported as being involved in a known, past scam. Currently, our data comes from the largest open-source repository of known cryptocurrency scams, CryptoScamDB, which is community-maintained & updated weekly- if not daily. BlockSpy is highly effective for determining if you’re about to transfer money to someone who is a known scammer or criminal.

Why Was BlockSpy Created?

The original implementation of BlockSpy was created for ConsenSys, as part of their Beyond Blockchain Hackathon that was co-hosted by Gitcoin back in mid-2019. The goal was to create a blockchain-based, DeFi product that not only provided risk assessment, but also increased transparency between participants. BlockSpy worked great in the form of a website, but we realized that we were asking too much of users to come to our website every time they wanted to check the validity of an address. That's why we were so excited when the MetaMask team announced support for plugins.

What’s Next For BlockSpy?

✅Finish V1 of plugin for MetaMask
☑️Add support for custom blacklists
☑️Create plugins for other wallets
☑️Add support for Bitcoin addresses
☑️Update backend with proprietary machine-learning algorithm

Who We Are

While the team is currently one founder/developer, we are actively looking to hire engineers who have experience with TensorFlow and other machine learning frameworks. This is for the sake of increasing the accuracy of our risk assessment algorithm by implementing some new ideas that have not been explored by any other blockchain security products. This is perhaps the most exciting part of BlockSpy, and we can't wait to tell you more about it!

Remember: Any donations to this project have the opportunity of being matched by the Ethereum foundation and other crypto organizations. So please, vote for us to make MetaMask more secure! 🔒",https://blockspy.net,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,https://github.com/craze3,1

We intend to contribute to real effects on state of world affairs with the PUBLICAE platform distributed ledger technology and our deployed ERC-20 Politicoin utility token.

PUBLICAE enables political advertisers to purchase the attention of people and reward them swiftly without delay as a “token” of appreciation. Users can earn Politicoins by watching video ads from publishers and convert their PBLC tokens to fiat currency or choose to donate some value back to their preferred organization. Users can also purchase PBLC tokens with Etherum without engaging with ad content. The PUBLICAE platform offers a secure KYC process, transparent and ethical outreach tools for Politically Exposed Persons and NGOs. Through these tools, users can offer their support and organisations can tokenize their advertising efforts with the decentralised PUBLICAE DApp platform.

By incorporating PUBLICAE blockchain technology and Politicoin to their advertising structures, political parties and non-governmental organisations like charities can minimize the burden of administrative advertising costs, reach a wider audience of potential donors and supporters as well as enable a higher level of accountability.

Voter turnout has been declining across the globe since the beginning of 1990s by an average of 20%, a trend which weakens democracies. Meta-analysis reveal that political ad spots increases issue knowledge, influences perceptions of the candidates’ character, alters attitudes, and affects candidate preference; influences agenda-setting, and alters viewers vote likelihood (turnout). Politicoin invites people worldwide, to engage in issue knowledge transfer based on their own personal financial gain interest through their monetized attention.

PUBLICAE is earnestly carrying out our due diligence to gather the support we need to empower people around the world and to achieve full compliance with Electoral Commision rules for Political Party Funding regulations worldwide. With the grants raised, we intend to develop an MVP of the complete PUBLICAE mobile and web platform, coordinate our efforts with other crypto-teams, build a critical user mass through promotional activities and position our value proposition in front of possible future clients.

2291,dodo-drop-a-smart-file-transfer-app-that-helps-yo,"Sharing can be hard sometimes, but, not anymore. Say hello to Dodo Drop - a cross-platform file sharing app that helps you do waymore. Send, pictures, share videos and audios, transfer large files or apps between all your devices. All of this with blazing fast speeds. Did I mention that you as a user can earn from it too? Cause, why not. 😉

What is Dodo Drop?

Dodo Drop is a cross-platform file-sharing app developed by a 17-year-old developer from the Jammu and Kashmir state.

Dodo Drop allows you to transfer photos, videos, music, documents, and apps from one device to another at a super-fast speed. It aims to enable airdrop-like functionality on all devices.

Various users are of the opinion that despite the internet and having a plethora of options to share files, they still want an app or a platform dedicated to tasks like sharing files. Dodo Drop just fits the bill as it helps users share large files, multiple files together, offers file format support, helps to maintain privacy, etc. Dodo Drop also comes to our rescue in remote areas as it works even without any internet connectivity.

Why Gitcoin Grants?

I've been coding since I was nine. I've funded everything using my pocket money. While my journey has been incredible, after all, I am still a 17-year-old, meaning I don't have enough money to continue working on this project. It is worth mentioning here that Jammu & Kashmir has been getting restricted internet connectivity for about a year now. Besides that, internet shutdown is common in the region. Internet Shutdown Tracker, a portal that tracks internet shutdowns across the country, reports that India saw an overall of 100 shutdown incidents between 2019 and March 2020.

I plan to launch Dodo Drop as a decentralized app on multiple platforms with super cool features. The possibilities are truly endless. I plan on using Gitcoin Grand funding to build out a suite of killer features to take the project to the next level.

Any amount you donate is very welcome.

2250,cura-network-the-decentralized-healthcare-system-,"Cura Network is a global decentralized health system comprising of patients, specialists, providers, and third-party app developers, collaborating and sharing data with each other to promote, restore or maintain health.

The quality of healthcare delivery relies on efficient and safe data management. Currently, patients’ medical records are stored in fragmented and insecure case files or isolated EHR systems.

This has led to:
Lack of data interoperability amongst healthcare providers
Inefficient treatment & increased cost of healthcare
Insecurity & lack of data privacy
Delay in treatment

There are 100+ server-based EHR systems, 20M+ health specialists and 220K+ healthcare providers globally, all operating in isolation in different parts of the world. Cura Network will be a single source of truth for patients’ medical records, unifying the current fragmented record-keeping systems.

This will provide:
Quality Healthcare: Access to quality healthcare from vetted specialists and providers across the globe.
Privacy & Access Control: Have ownership and control over your health records. Understand and determine how your data is being shared.
Global Decentralized Identity: Each entity is given a Cura Network Identity (CNID) representing an on-chain self-sovereign identity with unique role-based attributes.
Distributed Storage of Records: Cost savings in storage. High efficiency in data transfer with persistent availability. Simultaneous data delivery across multiple computers.
Third-party App Integrations: Data access layer for a plethora of existing or new health software applications. A single source of truth for  analytics and global research.
Equitable Economy: Inbuilt monetization at the very core. Earn tokens in an equitable system for data or services shared.

Why fund us?
Currently, what is obtainable for solving the problem of privacy and data interoperability are isolated healthcare systems that are localized to a specific healthcare provider or providers in a region. 

This does not provide for global access to healthcare records for patients, and interoperability anywhere in the world for specialists and providers.

1110,minerva-wallet-the-mobile-metamask-alternative-pa,"It has never been so easy to manage all crypto assets with just one wallet. Especially the NFT support is outstanding in comparison to other wallets or the native apps from popular NFT platforms. With this new Gitcoin round we are fired up for everything the future holds! We’ve come a long way since the beginning, and thanks to our dear community and loyal users, we are flying higher up in the skies - and the view just keeps getting better. 
 
Soon you will see new networks being available in the wallet offering every Minerva Wallet user the access to the network of choice and while many users struggle to find a suitable mobile wallet in addition to Metamask on Desktop, we think that Minerva is the one you should have a look at. If you use the same Secret Recovery Phrase, you will get the first 5 accounts on all the supported networks. No worries - we also will work on the limited number of accounts. 😊
The exquisite Automated Token Discovery is helping with the often cumbersome 'add token' logic and because you likely don't want to see all dumped tokens, you can always disable them as well. 
 
The wallet is multi-network and multi-account, so you don’t have to sacrifice your time in order to jump between many accounts on different networks. It supports WalletConnect so that you can connect to hundreds of DApps and, as mentioned before, it has now a full NFT integration. Once the Automated Token Discovery did the heavy lifting for you, magically and automatically, you will see all trusted tokens with a proper icon and a fiat price provided by CoinGecko. Additionally you can easily top-up one of your accounts with crypto through Ramp.Network.
 
All of that is wrapped up in a very intuitive and user-friendly interface, with no learning curve at all. Give it a try and download on the Google PlayStore!
 
Additionally, we've introduced a special gift to our community called the Minerva Streaming Farms, which have been “flying” at full speed since the very moment they opened. This is a favorite among our users and a perk many folks enjoy - keep your eyes on these farms! The farms combined with our native and first ever streamable SuperToken MIVA makes for a lot of excitement among our lovely community. 
 
The ride so far has been delightful - but we know our history is only beginning. We invite all of you to be part of this journey and grow with us! Let’s all reach new heights together! 
 
We continue to be deeply grateful to our entire community - you’re the reason we’ve come this far! Your feedback, your insight, your voice keeps us strong, united and focused. Our pride never fades when looking at our amazing user base and we couldn’t be more thankful for all the support you’ve given us. Thank you, to all and each one of you!
 
And with a farewell chirp from our charming - did we mention smart too? - purple owl, we bid you goodbye…! But not without reminding you how fast it is to create your account with us: 3 clicks, 5 seconds and that’s it, you’re done and in total control of your own matters!
 
Privacy, security and efficiency - all delivered by a cute little owl. Take the chance to be your own sovereign. Don’t keep yourself waitin, it’s a thrilling and freeing experience - such as flying. Come and join us!
 
TL;DR (regular user): Minerva is just like your physical wallet, but 10x better: It simplifies everything you do with it, from your own identities to all of your money. After the initial setup, which is done in less than a minute, you can start interacting with your favorite applications right away, or just familiarize yourself with crypto in the test environment. Over time you will be able to explore even more options, always staying in absolute control over your assets.  
 
TL;DR (tech nerd): Minerva safely stores multiple DIDs, Verifiable Credentials and all tokens on various EVM networks, via EOAs and Gnosis Safe contract accounts and documents all interactions. What makes Minerva unique is its 'Multi-Account-Multi-Network' privacy-enabling user interface. Minerva Wallet supports 8 main networks and 12 test networks with many more networks planned to come, all in one app. DApp interaction is enabled via WalletConnect, so that your Minerva Wallet can directly tap into the DeFi world with multiple sessions on multiple accounts.

As a Full-Stack developer I have seen the need to make use of citizen information (public domain information that should be available and accessible by law) but in the search I realized that although this information (in part) is available, It is not organized in a way that is easy to use for other purposes, which may be from consulting the data to preparing it for statistical use or using it to create computer products aimed at citizens. Another problem that I frequently encounter is the lack of a standard in the format of these files. As well as the use of formats that allow us to extract this information easily. Just like me, I know that there are other Dominicans needing to access this data and that is why I decided to create a REST API to facilitate the access and distribution of this public information.

As a result, traditional media is rapidly losing its trust, influence and control to social media, resulting in misinformation jeopardizing society. In a world where citizens no longer trust media, anarchy will follow as we have clearly seen happening in the USA earlier this year

We have a solution to restore trust in online media. The reputation protocol enables consumers to rate content based on their reputation and gives them the tools to know what content to read, share or engage in. We take into consideration a user’s reputation and relevant expertise to determine the level of influence and to hold users accountable, even if they choose to publish anonymously to protect themselves. 

The protocol thus enables people to remain 100% anonymous if wanted but to be held accountable. To achieve this, we have developed private smart contracts and it merges anonymity and accountability. We call this anonymous accountability, protecting freedom of speech while storing reputation immutably on chain.

Mavin consists of two tools: 
A rating widget that enables the crowd and AI to rate articles based on several parameters and where we take into account the reputation and expertise of the user/.
A self-moderating commenting tool that allows readers to provide context to content while blocking bad bots and trolls and reducing misinformation.

What is Unfate?

Unfate is the educational platform dedicated to Web3. I currently have more than 480 early access subscribers waiting for the launch of the platform with great enthusiasm.

When I started DeFi I’ve made a lot of mistakes, lost funds because I didn’t know how to use MetaMask, didn’t know how to use Decentralized Exchanges, and got into obvious Ponzi Schemes. It would have been amazing if I had a dedicated learning platform that I could use and prevent me these mistakes.

The goal of Unfate is to primarily give people a top Web3 Education through a platform with an incredible User Experience and High-Quality Courses(DeFi, NFT, Gaming, DAOs, and more).

Students who finished a course with a passing score will be rewarded with an NFT certification. Engaged students can also be rewarded through a partnership with protocols, it might be a rare NFT or Tokens.



Why Gitcoin Grants?

3 months ago, I’ve started the UX design then coded Unfate with no funding at all. I’ve progressed a lot on the project and almost finished the platform. But I have great difficulty finding high-quality educators and incentivizing them to create step-by-step full courses.

The Gitcoin grant would help me fund courses that the community students are interested to learn about. Here are some examples of courses:
   - Basics of Decentralized Finance
   - Mastering Decentralized Exchanges
   - Beginner to Advanced on Stablecoins

This unique (nonprofit) incubator model allows startups to grow without being financially burdened or having to give up equity. In return, they are expected to help manage and grow the local blockchain community.

Why Here?
Innovation develops within a complex regulatory, financial, social and global ecosystem. We provide a space in Washington DC for nuanced collaboration between public and private stakeholders focused on using blockchain technology to accomplish tangible goals.

Why Now?
We need products, not promises. This industry is crowded with claims and platitudes, but few real-world solutions. BlockShop provides space and connections to help blockchain builders build.

DEAD ENGINEERS SOCIETY
Dead Engineers Society is a network of engineers who help each other to get their projects off the ground. It acts as a grassroots incubator and an open-source foundation focusing on supporting technology that brings a positive impact on society and can benefit people beyond BlockShop. The participating engineers agree to contribute to each other's projects on a voluntary basis without claiming the ownership or enforcing any licensing. Our expertise spans across Software Development, IT Security, DevOps, AI, Neuroscience, and Applied Linguistics. In addition to this, we help early-stage projects with infrastructure resources, project management, and hiring efforts.

Events
BlockShop organizes and hosts events with leaders from tech, Wall Street, venture capital, nonprofits and government. Our events focus exclusively on concrete applications of blockchain solutions – i.e., products, not promises.

Networking
We also host networking events for BlockShop members and newbies. Rotating themes will include start-up pitch nights, group brainstorming for specific industry issues, engagement with regulators and other policymakers, brass-tacks how-to talks, and more.

Donate today and help us reach out goal of supporting 20 projects in 2020.

Libp2p is a revolutionary networking stack that powers Polkadot, Filecoin, and ETH2.0. Though, due to its modular nature and the lack of in-depth tutorials, it is challenging for new developers to get started with the library. 

Learnp2p is an open-source interactive tutorial, inspired by CryptoZombies, that gamifies the process of learning Libp2p. We think that this tutorial will be a boon to the p2p community as it’ll lower down the barrier for new developers.

Let's fund together solarpunk artists and let's flood Google Image Search with new solarpunk results that anyone can use and spread far and wide.

*** UPDATE SINCE GR13 ***
We decided to expand the scope of this grant to invite all artists around the world to help us reimagine any city in a regenerative future.
We need more solarpunk art and web3 gives us the tools to fund artists (you've heard of NFTs right?).

*** UPDATE SINCE GR12 ***
We raised $4,217 (€3700) out of the €5000 budget for artists
45 people registered
Story published in the local media
Onboarded a couple of new artists to NFTs

Vernissage Sunday March 20th was a success!
60 people showed up. Lot of positive feedback. We definitely put Solarpunk on the map :-)

The winning piece: Square de Noville by Clothilde Buvat and Philip Stessens: NFT on opensea: https://opensea.io/collection/tavubforimaginebrussels

As Rob Hopkins postulates in his latest book “What If”, beyond the ecological crisis, we have a crisis of imagination. We are incapable of imagining an economy that wouldn't be driven by consumption and infinite growth, we are incapable of imagining our cities without private cars, with more green and safe spaces for our kids, etc.

To make the future happen, we first need to envision it, to dream it. That's why we need artists to show us images of the future.

This is what the solarpunk movement is all about. It envisions how the future might look if humanity succeeded in solving major contemporary challenges with an emphasis on sustainability, climate change and pollution (wikipedia).

The contest imagine.brussels March 2022

Artists will have till February 27th to submit their art piece as an NFT. An exhibition will be organized at the Citizen Corner in Brussels from March 20th till April 16th, at the end of which the winners will be announced. The winning art pieces will be bought by a DAO so that we can all collectively own them.
This is a great opportunity to onboard many artists to web3 as we will organize workshops to help them set up their metamask and mint their first NFTs (we will use opensea.io with the PoS chain Polygon). It's also an opportunity to experiment with retroactive public goods funding as anyone can speculate on which NFTs will eventually win. And finally, it's an opportunity to kickstart DAO.brussels, the first DAO for the capital of Europe.


This is very much an experiment and we will share our learnings along the way. We hope to create a blueprint to enable fellow citizens in other cities to organize their own solarpunk NFT contests and create their own DAO to make those images of the future reality.

1595,bloom-network,"Bloom Network is a climate action network with on-the-ground DAOs and an online social network. We help more people find and participate in regenerative actions. (Regenerative means the opposite of exhaustive.)

Local Bloom DAOs do regenerative actions on the ground, such as planting community gardens, teaching people to form agroforestry cooperatives, and creating regional token economies focused on land and water stewardship. Over time, they create better connectivity between existing projects and organizations in a place, just like mushrooms in nature help transfer nutrients and information across the forest floor. 

Local Blooms cooperatively own and govern the platform - rather than Facebook where executives call the shots, Bloom's social network is led by and focused on local well-being. We are 30,000 people on the ground in 16 local Bloom chapters across 8 countries, and our tech team comes from HBO, dOrg, and Brainfog gaming. And we are ready to scale up mass participation in regeneration.

What problem do we address?
Grassroots solutions to climate change are underfunded. They’re hard for funders to vet, and less than 10% of international climate funds go to local communities. The public cannot find these solutions to participate in and support because mainstream business models don’t boost their visibility.

How?
Bloom hosts local hands-on events and virtual interactive media to scale up public participation in regenerative solutions. Everywhere there is a local Bloom chapter, we network together local initiatives to reach more participants and learn from one another. 

Here’s a demo of the platform we’re building for grassroots community organizers to collaborate effectively globally. It describes how we use web3 ReFi tools for membership and payments for regenerative actions and contributing local action templates. Members receive tokens and local governance power for doing regenerative actions. At the end of the year they receive a % of profits proportional to actions they've done. Your contributions this round will help us complete it and launch so local movement organizers can develop climate and social justice projects better and faster.


GR14 Goals:

Your contributions will help more IRL communities create DAO treasuries to do local climate repair work, with the support of a global community of peers.

Publish the templates we've collected from Local Blooms hubs, for how to set up crop swaps, community gardens, syntropic agroforestry, how to form a team, and more.
Complete the formation of our DAO as a CO Limited Cooperative Association so that local Blooms can financially intercooperate
Implement member subscription NFT using Unlock Protocol
Direct 80% of each members’ subscription fee to their local Bloom DAO treasury
Metadata standards for our regenerative economic protocol, rewarding members for doing regenerative actions for carbon drawdown, social equity, and health.

Completed with contributions so far!

13 years R&D prototyping local actions across the world
Multi-user blogging platform focused on regenerative actions
Profiles system that will dock with MyMeta’s version of Ceramic profiles for portable data and cross-website collaboration
Collected initial set of action templates from 5 local Blooms across 4 countries: create community gardens, year 1 on a plot of land, local crop swaps, DAO proposal templates, and more.
Designed our cooperative patronage token as a stable legal pathway for DAOs. Members and local Bloom DAOs will receive tokens for doing regenerative actions, and a corresponding % of year-end profits. Their governance power is pegged to regenerative actions they’ve done.

2435,nft-kit,"A turnkey solution for creators to create and sell digital collectibles to their fans and followers.

NFT Kit is being built for three main purposes:

To provide the most user-friendly and affordable way to mint an NFT.
To create an education center to make all aspects of NFTs more accessible, from the financial to the technical.
To allow creators to expand the ways in which they allow their fans to support their work to unique digital collectibles, and dynamic exclusive content.

We've set out to create an NFT minting platform that abstracts away the complexities, replaces the technical jargon with simpler language and clear guidance throughout the entire process, and provides educational material to make this exciting technology truly accessible to anyone, regardless of their level of technical know-how. NFTs should not just be about gated exclusive galleries and million-dollar ""drops"" for only a handful of people. It's also not only for traditional and digital artists. Creators such as podcasters, comic artists, YouTubers, and anyone who supports their work through their fans through Patreon or other means, should be able to utilize this technology.

Creators should not have to guess or start googling to learn what gas is or how much the current cost might before they sign for payment. They should be informed about where their assets actually live, as well as be able to explicitly communicate the rights their NFTs do and do not carry to the buyer.

In addition to a simple and user-friendly interface, here are some of the unique features being built:

A Pre-Minting Option - The ability to upload and setup up your NFT without paying the minting fee until it is sold.
While the NFT will not be minted onto the blockchain yet, the assets will be uploaded to IPFS/Filecoin and generate a Content Identifier/Hash to identify copies and serve as evidence of the original upload time
Automated Minimal Minting Cost - An automated ""limit order"" type system, that calculates the average low-end cost over the past 24-48 hours and delays minting until the gas fees go below the threshold.
Dynamic NFT Modules - The ability to create dynamic, programmable NFTs using custom ""modules"" to make it easier to art that changes based on data, time, and other parameters.
Embeddable NFTs - The ability to embed and sell your NFT on your own website!
Pay with a credit card - Many artists and creators are new to this space, and this will allow them to get started quickly without having to figure out how to buy ETH in addition to setting up a wallet.
Marketplace Integrations - Integration with OpenSea and other potentially other marketplaces that support direct integrations.
Education Center - Informing both creators and buyers on all aspects of dealing with NFTs, from process and costs to copyright issues and tax liabilities. Explaining how NFTs work under the hood for those who want to nerd out on technical, as well as explaining how and where to view your NFT or how to access unlockable content.

Upcoming features on our roadmap:

Collaborations - NFT with multiple creators/owners, and royalty divisions.
L2 integration for faster, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly minting.
Carbon Offset - Contribute a portion of the art sale to offset carbon emissions just by clicking a check box.
Local Asset Certification - A native app to create a content identifier hash locally without uploading your media, to generate a digital proof of original content before your creation ever leaves your computer.
Community Fund - Some of the proceeds will go into a pool that will be used to offset minting fees for users and potentially provide grants for artists and creators.
Cross platform Gallery App (for TVs, mobile devices, and web) - Display your Art and NFTs in a minimal, beautiful, clean interface. Customize views, add information, view all relevant links, and more. 

Some Features We're Contemplating:

Automated Bonding Curves
Social Marketplace - Allow community members to upvote works, create curated lists, and follow one another for increased visibility.

There are many more nuances to this project that are being worked on and tested, but the hope is to truly make a platform that opens this world up to as many people as who want to partake in it, make it easy and affordable to dabble and experiment and provide a place that listens to feedback and pain points to be able to address them and reduce technical and monetary friction to be able to make and sell NFTs.

I am currently the main developer on this project but have a Graphic+UX Designer, and an Ethereum consultant working on this project with me.
I'm open to collaborates of all kinds, as well as any feedback and suggestions, which are highly welcome! 

A little about me:

131,you-decentralized-password-management,"You. is a password manager leveraging decentralized storage and messaging that authenticates Web 2.0 and Web 3 logins with your mobile device.
 
A seamless login experience by leveraging human friendly security technologies for logins with minimal disruptive interaction by using biometric authentication like FaceID to unlock the secure enclave of a mobile device accessing the stored passwords.

In our opinion a secure open source and decentralized password manager should be available for anyone to use.

Prototype built at ETHBerlin
During the ETHBerlin hackathon a prototype of You. was built and showcased to the jury. You. not only managed to win one of the ten open track prices but also the 3box storage bounty as well as the Consensys Grants security bounty.

How does it work?
👉 Youtube Video

You. provides a secure Chrome Extension, which communicates with your You. app installed on your phone. Whenever there is a login field and a password is available, the chrome extension recognizes it and triggers a push notification, you then need to confirm the login with your biometrics, after the confirmation your browser logs you successfully into the web service.

You has 3 components:
Mobile Application
Chrome Extension
Push Notifications Oracle

These three components communicate to each other using only secure 3box messaging. All persisted data is encrypted using an advanced crypto system that allows for:
multi party sharing using Diffie Helmann
complete recovery using Ethereum account
secure storage of sensitive data on public context
cuckoo filter lookups of entries
easy change of Ethereum accounts

Mobile Application
This is the actual password manager and the bridge between your passwords and you. Using secure enclave unlocked by biometrics the user becomes the authentication. Whenever a new login request reaches the device the user is prompted to approve the authentication. If the approval was positive using 3box messaging the encrypted credentials are sent to the chrome extension who will input them in the form.

Chrome Extension
This component is responsible to detect sites that contain login fields and the password manager knows a credential for. The latter is done by using a cuckoo filter which is shared from the mobile application. The chrome extension itself does never have access to all passwords, only the ones forwarded by the mobile application.

Push Notification Oracle
This component is responsible to trigger a push notification on the mobile device. The communication with this oracle happens using 3box messaging feature. The workflow is that a Mobile Device registers a given Ethereum address with a push token. Then when the Chrome Extension gets a login request, it will forward the details to the push oracle, who sends a push notification to the mobile application.

From Prototype to MVP
With the funding from you we want to take the next step and develop the prototype to a usable MVP in the following phases.

Phase 1
You. MVP - a functional MVP built from the ETHBerlin prototype. Android and iOS mobile apps with the Chrome Extension. Adding new passwords and managing existing ones.

Mobile Apps for Android and iOS
Built with the hybrid framework ionic using Angular Typescript
Cordova plugin for native components
Mnemonic backup phrase based on Ethereum support
Chrome Extension 
cuckoo discovery for passwords
3Box Storage for storing encrypted password storage
3Box messaging for encrypted and secure communication channel between mobile device and Chrome Extension
Firebase push notifications

Prerequisites
ETHBerlin prototype

Expected Deliverables
Android and iOS application
secure storage accessible by biometrics
push notifications
Chrome Extension
login field detection of stored passwords
Adding and managing passwords flows
Communication between mobile apps and chrome extension

By using cryptographic accumulators, the integrity of data on the Argennon cloud is guaranteed, and there is no need for trusting cloud servers. At the same time, by using a smart clustering algorithm the network usage and the overhead of the commitment scheme is kept manageable. An initial draft of the Argennon white paper can be found here. 

Until the launch of the Argennon mainnet, an ERC20 token and a governance system, called ADAGs (/eɪ-dagz/), will be created, in order to represent investors’ share in the project and giving them the opportunity to determine the project path

An overview of notable properties of the Argennon platform:

Argennon is a cloud based blockchain. Argennon validators do not keep a local copy of the state data. Instead, the state is stored on a trust-less cloud of publicly verifiable database (PV-DB) servers.
By using cryptographic commitment schemes the integrity of data on the cloud is guaranteed, and there is no need for trusting PV-DB servers. At the same time, by using a smart clustering algorithm the network usage and the overhead of the commitment scheme is kept manageable.
Argennon uses a hybrid POS consensus protocol. A democratically elected committee of delegates is responsible for minting and proposing new blocks. Then, each block is validated by a large committee of normal validators. Every Argennon user is a member of at least one committee of validators. Thanks to the cloud based design of the Argennon blockchain, transaction validation does not require a large physical storage space and being a validator does not require costly computational resources. Everyone with an Argennon wallet can participate in the Argennon consensus protocol. This makes Argennon a truly democratic and decentralized blockchain.
Sharding decreases the security of a blockchain. Argennon does not need shards. Due to the cloud based design of the Argennon blockchain, validators do not need to validate blocks sequentially and the validation of multiple blocks can be done in parallel by different committees of validators.
By using a dependency detection algorithm, Argennon is also able to parallelize transaction validation of a single block. As a result, a multicore machine is able to validate the Argennon blockchain as fast as multiple independent shards.
The hybrid Argennon consensus protocol makes Argennon one of the most secure blockchains. Only one honest delegate can stop any attacks against the integrity of the Argennon blockchain, and if all the delegates are malicious, as long as more than half of the Argennon total stake is controlled by honest users, the Argennon blockchain will preserve its consistency.
The Argennon network relies on a permission-less network of PV-DB servers, forming the Argennon cloud. A PV-DB server is a conventional data server which uses its computational and storage resources to help the Argennon network process transactions. A large portion of incentive rewards in the Argennon protocol is devoted to PV-DB servers. This will incentivize the development of conventional networking, storage and computational hardware, which can benefit all areas of information technology. This contrasts with the approach of other blockchains that incentivize development of a totally useless technology of hash calculation.
By design, the Argennon blockchain is decoupled from cryptography. There is no hash based addresses and a user can easily change his/her private keys. Moreover, If at any time the cryptographic algorithms used become insecure, they could be easily upgraded.
In Argennon, operations are authorized by explicit signatures. This eliminates the need for approval schemes or call back patterns and encourages developers to better utilize the capabilities of digital signatures.
The Argennon Smart Contract Execution Environment (AscEE) is able to execute a smart contract as fast as a native application. This means that an Argennon smart contract is as efficient as the AscEE code itself. This way, performing costly mathematical calculations with a smart contract is not an engineering mistake anymore.
The Argennon Execution Environment protects smart contracts from reentrancy by low level locks. These locks will be opened automatically so there will be no risk of permanent deadlocks. The Argennon Execution Environment also provides deferred calls mechanism, which enables a smart contract to call back another smart contract without causing reentrancy complexities.
An Argennon smart contract can safely call external smart contracts. There is no way that a smart contract can affect its caller. Even the execution resources are separated and the called smart contract can not abort the execution of its caller by excessive gas usage.
Most of the arithmetic in the Argennon Execution Environment is done using floating point operations instead of unsigned integer operations. As a result, there will be almost no need for a word size bigger than 64 bits. At the same time, operations will have a bounded fractional error in contrast to integer operations that could have an arbitrary large fractional error.
The Argennon Execution Environment provides a built-in standard library. This standard library provides a secure and convenient way for implementing many frequently used functionalities. In addition, this library is updatable through the Argennon governance system. This means that bugs or security vulnerabilities in the AscEE standard library could be quickly patched and smart contracts that use this library, including non-updatable smart contracts, can benefit from improvements and bug fixes.
Argennon standards are defined based on how a contract should use the AscEE standard library and not only how its interface should look. As a result, users can expect certain type of behaviour from a contract which complies with an Argennon standard.
Interaction with Argennon smart contract is done through conventional HTTP. This enables Argennon smart contracts to have HTTP based RESTful APIs, documented by standardized descriptions like OpenAPI. This way, any client, including clients being used for conventional centralized web services, will be able to use Argennon smart contracts, regardless of how the API is implemented internally.
ARG, the main currency of the Argennon blockchain, is controlled by a smart contract. This eliminates the need for ARG wrappers and also makes the transfer logic of ARG more transparent and trustable.
Memory architecture of the AscEE completely hides the complexities of the Argennon blockchain. This enables AscEE compatible programming languages to have a flavour completely similar to conventional programming languages. For instance, the Argon language, which is the primary AscEE OOP language, supports composition, which is a very important OO design pattern.

PVD Things is an up-and-coming library of things in Providence, Rhode Island. A library of things is just like a regular library, but for borrowing power tools, hand tools, ladders, games, and more. Lots of these libraries have been springing up around the world from Vancouver to Berlin.

PVD Things is special because it is cooperatively run. Members join PVD Things by purchasing a Member Share. Members each have one vote at co-op meetings and elect the Board.

Who are we?

We are Starboard, a software developer co-op from Rhode Island. We're currently developing a free and open source full-stack application for PVD Things, which can show the ""thing"" inventory and eventually allow people to make reservations and participate in democratic decision-making.

Why do we need money?

We would like to reimagine the application as a blockchain app that can not only power PVD Things, but other existing and forthcoming tool lending libraries around the world. Most tool libraries are using a proprietary piece of software that is locking them into a walled garden with no means of escape. We would like to build a dApp that can be that escape.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has cast a harsh light on inequality in our society. Recommendations like self-quarantining, washing hands, and staying home from work and school are just not possible for everyone we serve. Despite the outbreak, TGP is committed to continuing to serve these vulnerable people during this public health emergency by providing access to hygiene, food, and other critical resources to support the health and safety of this vulnerable population.

However, we need to protect our staff and volunteers. TGP is taking careful precautions to protect the health and safety of staff, volunteers, and the people we serve, including increased routine cleaning and disinfection of our facility. Staff and volunteers who are sick are being required to remain away from TGP until they are symptom-free. As a result, we are remaining open for emergency services, but other programs will be scaled back during this time.

Finally, we also greatly need monetary donations (including crypto!) to ensure that we can continue providing these vital and life-saving services. We expect to see a greater need for food assistance as members experience loss of work/pay due to current economic conditions. We also expect to see more families seeking aid and support to make it through the extended school closures that have been announced in the area.

The health of the greater public is not defined by those with the most access, but by those with the least. Now more than ever, your Denver community needs your help. If you have the means, please donate cryptocurrency to us.

205,radicalxchange-foundation,"RadicalxChange Foundation, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, aims to build a coherent and sustainable alternative to capitalism.

We are deeply concerned about worsening economic inequality, ideologically divided societies, and decaying democratic institutions. And we are equally concerned that these difficulties tempt many towards the “quick fixes” of more authoritarian governance.

We believe that the path forward leads instead through a rigorous, clear-eyed reexamination of the basic building blocks of capitalism and democracy.

Just because something calls itself a “market” doesn’t mean it’s fair. For example, poorly-designed private property schemes reward rent-seeking. Our economy will never be just (or efficient) if the reward for success is the privilege of exploiting the labor of others. Likewise, we are failing to grapple with the challenges of the data economy, to adequately fund public goods, and to carry out common-sense antitrust reforms.

Democracy, too, could use an update. The principle of self-governance is one to which we are absolutely committed. But the voting protocols that we now use–largely inherited from the 18th century–lend themselves to serious problems. More modern voting methods can mitigate old challenges such as the oppression of minority groups and the outsize influence of zealous factions. Such reforms have the potential to enhance the legitimacy of democracy itself, restoring public faith in democracy as a system of governance, and revitalizing many institutions.

The challenges that RadicalxChange seeks to address are becoming more acute as the world changes. New technologies have already created unforeseen challenges for economic justice and democracy. To address the even greater challenges on the horizon (both technological and environmental) we will need better and fairer institutions, capable of balancing the competing demands of acting decisively and while managing exceptionally broad-based participation in power.

Our work is guided by a commitment to more egalitarian and democratic societies, as well as by an embrace of markets, community, decentralization, and a determination to collaborate across difference.

351,charged-particles-defi-nft-interest-bearing-non-f,"Charged Particles allows you to turn your NFT into a basket holding ANY token (even another NFTs!)! The Charged Particles Protocol and first DApp was launched in Feb-2021. 

A ""Charged Particle"" is an interest-bearing Non-Fungible Tokens (DeFi NFTs) that is minted with an Asset Token (ie. DAI, USDT, etc..) and accrues interest through a Liquidity Provider (ie. Aave, yEarn, etc..) giving the Token a ""Charge"". The amount of interest earned from the token represents the ""Charge"" that the token (Particle) has amassed. 

The principal (mass) and interest (charge) are completely programmable. The principal can be time-locked, providing royalties for generations. You can even discharge the accrued interest to a different address - a friend? a donation? Your choice.

NFT Value Appreciation
Imagine a Babe Ruth rookie card stuffed with $1 and earning interest since 1916!
Or a piece of digital-art holding $10 and constantly appreciating in value!

Particle Value =
Intrinsic Value (underlying value of Asset-Tokens)
+ Speculative Value (non-fungible rarity)
+ Interest Value (accrued in Interest-Tokens)

Ownership
Charged Particles NFTs are yours - They are standard, non-custodial NFTs, held in your wallet, and can be ""discharged"" at any time, collecting any accrued interest from the token.

Custom Token Mechanics
Charged Particles introduce unique token mechanics allowing Smart Contracts and/or DApps to decide how to handle a specific token based on the level of ""Charge"" that token has.

Imagine an NFT that represents a Sword - the power of that sword could be dependant on the amount of ""Charge"" the token has. Or perhaps certain items can only be used once they reach a certain level of charge. Discharging the particle resets the in-game token mechanics.

Other possibilities include battling over the ""charge"" of a particle - the winner earns the interest from their competitor's particles.

Any existing NFT can be given a ""Charge""! What's in Your NFT?

4061,a-game-for-realizing-desired-futures-stopping-coa,"Solidarity is a game, where we work together to make the worlds and futures we desire. Sort of like Civilization or World of Warcraft, except in real-life.

Instead of fighting dragons, we create the futures we wish for — resisting fossil fuel infrastructure, ending ecological degradation, and transforming our local systems. And when we k̴i̴l̴l̴ ̴a̴ ̴d̴r̴a̴g̴o̴n̴ realize a desired future, we all enjoy the resources and opportunities it provides.

Imagine one such situation: stopping the Adani coal plant in Australia:




If we stop this project, we'll save 4.6 billion tons of emissions and 270 billion liters of groundwater, protect the Great Barrier Reef from 500 passing coal ships every year, and support our Wangan and Jagalingou relatives.  We’re all in this together.  How can we coordinate our attention, our energy, and our capital — and start living like it?

Sending support to communities on the frontlines. Contributing to arts, stories, and movements that shift paradigms. Finding ways to support our allies the best we can, and leading change in our own communities as well.

The purpose of this proposal is to realize the futures we wish for, through coordination and solidarity.  As Indigenous communities resist fossil fuel infrastructure and genocide, they save our air, water, biodiversity, and collective capacity.  As the students march in the streets and fight Big Oil in court, they shift paradigms and systems. As communities localize their ways of life, they lower the emissions and warming of our shared atmosphere.

Because the stakes are real. This is real lives — of our human relatives, today and in the future. Of insects, mammals, fish and cephalopods. Of fauna and fungi, of rivers and mycelia and glaciers. With that, comes real responsibility.  If you/we take actions that move us further from the futures we wish for, we’re further from the futures we wish for. If you/we fail to engage and take action at all, we’re just as far from those futures as well.

And our successes are real too. Can you imagine the celebration of falling a fossil fuel project? Of phasing out a destructive corporation? Of individuals and communities, transcending our status quos (petrodollars, colonialism, authoritarianism) — and the celebrations of new opportunities to come? We’ve experienced these victories, now and then. And yet, these challenges us are facing us every day. The opportunities for better futures are greeting us every moment.

Our cultures, our non-human relatives, our resources and future abundance, our peace and prosperity, social capital, and self-determination — it's all in our hands.  The game is running.  We're in it. What will we do?

To get started, you can support this grant. Your contribution (and matched funds) will be distributed to organizations on the frontlines of fossil fuel resistance movements. You’ll receive credit for this support, so when the Adani coal plant falls — you’ll see the futures that your action empowered.  And as we enjoy the fruits of those futures — in our atmosphere, our groundwater, the Great Barrier Reef, and the worlds of our Indigenous relatives — you'll be able to look back and say, ""I was there, here are the futures that I supported and helped empower.""

And you can do much more than give as well — anything, as long as it's in solidarity with and consented by those we wish to support. Create art and stories to share the voices of frontline communities. Amplify their messages and calls throughout our networks. Hold local gatherings to talk about these issues, and help our neighbors to support these futures with us.

And of course, organizing for change in the communities where we live as well.

The possibilities are as endless as our collective imaginations. Our prosperity and futures will be determined by our successes.

This game — involving credits, coordination, creative action for real-life outcomes, and celebrations of stopping coal plants — is simply a lense on reality, to help us wake up and pick up our agency. Because we're already deciding our futures — whether our world will warm by 1.7 or 3 degrees, whether our biodiversity will survive our collapse, whether we'll lead transitions or sink into status quos — through our actions every day, every moment.  Let's make the best of them.
________________

On a practical note, we envision this game as enabling people to share actions of solidarity and support, record those actions on IPFS (if desired), and have some basic game-like concepts around the actions and outcomes. More ""Stack Overflow"" than gamification really — where the main metrics come back to how much you've contributed and engaged to support desired futures. More intrinsic motivation than external. And perhaps reputation, personal pride, sort of like badges.  Being able to look back and say ""I was there, here are the futures I helped to create.""

Any input, criticisms, questions, feedback all welcome. If you have any concerns or see potential harms from something like this, please share that as well. The purpose of this is simply to support outcomes — so if it doesn't seem pragmatic/wise, or there could be any other issues, there's no ego or attachment to the concept.

178,automatic-transformation-of-xml-namespaces-and-xm,"Automatically transform between XML namespaces.
https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Automatic_transformation_of_XML_namespaces
This is an alpha. It is already useful to process XInclude, XML comments, and some home-made XHTML extensions.
See https://vporton.github.io/xml-boiler-docs/ for help.
This project supersedes failed project https://github.com/vporton/xml-boiler-java and https://github.com/vporton/xml-boiler.
The project is somehow stalled (because I spend time earning money), but I am serious to keep going.
Project description
Overview
It was written a specification (draft but already ""functional"") for automatic transformation and validation of complex (possibly multi-namespace) XML documents based on namespaces, written a software (XML Boiler, see https://github.com/vporton/xml-boiler) to implement these transformations. Written a short tutorial for XML Boiler.
Most of the specification was implemented in Python programming language. This project prototype ""XML Boiler"" is already nearly complete and is practically useful.
The most high priority current project goal is to rewrite the entire project in D programming language (because Python was found too slow and also not enough reliable).
Also we need better validation support and more transformers/validators need to be written, as well as many more features to implement. The specification needs to be improved to reach non-draft state.
Additional project purpose: Develop some general purpose (foundational) libraries for D programming language.
The benefits of the project include:
freely intermix tag sets of different sets of tag semantics (using XML namespaces), without disturbing each other (such as by name clash) in the global world
add your new tags to HTML (and other XML-based formats)
get rid of using HTML in the future Web, switch it to proper semantic XML formats
make XSL-format based browsers with automatic generation of XSL from other XML formats
make automatic coloring of source listings (for example)
add macroses and include (such as by XInclude) other files in XML
intermix different XML formats, with intelligent automatic processing of the mix
embed one XML format in another one
automatically choose the order of different XML converters applied to your mixed XML file
make browsers to show your XML in arbitrary format
make processing XML intelligent (with your custom scripts), both on the level of scripts and on the level of interactions between scripts
integrating together XML conversion and validation scripts written in multiple programming languages
associating semantics (such as relations with other namespaces and validation rules) to a namespace
semantics can be described as an RDF resource at a namespace URL (or a related URL)
many more opportunities
integrate all of the above in single command

Intellectual Merit
There was no automatic way to transform between XML files of different formats previously. This new way is a technological revolution. The same concerns validation of multi-namespace XML documents.
The main author’s invention is an elaborate automatic selection of the order (with repetitions if needed) of the XML transformations apply to the transformed XML file or its parts (processing of XML file by parts is also an author’s invention).
The project’s philosophical value is assigning semantics to XML namespaces, mainly as interrelations between different namespaces, what was previously considered like something non-existing.
The specification written is a breakthrough in XML processing. Many details were needed to be resolved in a clever way when writing it.
The D language is considered by the author as the currently most advanced and perspective programming language, thus making the purpose to advance D libraries important. Broader Impacts The project intends to replace older means such as HTML and TeX/LaTeX, so revolutionizing such things as the Web and scientific writing.
A future HTML replacement could be done in practice in the following steps:
Develop some tag sets by independent users or standardization committees. Use my software to convert XML files containing them to usual HTML for legacy browser compatibility.
Standardize news tag sets as a part of a new post-HTML standard(s).
Support the new tags sets in browsers (and other HTML software such as search engines). This would provide a smooth, multi-stage transition from legacy HTML to a new standard, what is before was impossible due to complexity of this global social process not being split into appropriate multiple stages, not allowing public participation of persons outside central standardization committees and smooth transition to new standards while the browsers are not yet updated (the chicken-egg problem: we were unable to update browsers while the standards are not yet updated and unable to update standards while the browsers are not yet updated, and also the need to do all the work in a central standardization committee not allowing enough public participation in developing a future HTML replacement).
Future TeX/LaTeX replacement could be done by developing a tag set (possibly including MathML for math formulas) for formatting complex “scientific” documents together with tag set(s) for complex Turing-complete logic (for such things as macroses and conditional processing, etc.) like one of TeX but much more convenient for the users and for transformation and data extraction software. Then this software could be optionally (partially) standardized. Unlike the above proposal of replacing HTML, for the TeX replacement it is not strictly necessary to create a browser software supporting it, but my software (together with scripts for it by other users) could itself be used as a TeX/LaTeX replacement. Then software for data transformation/extraction for databases like Scopus could be developed.
In the future RDF documents describing semantics of namespaces could be placed at namespace URLs (or related URLs) to support for anybody to be able to create and distribute his own XML tag sets standards and their semantics, without the need to resort to central standardization committees. (Scripts referred from such RDF documents could be executed in secure software sandboxes.)
The project files (including the documentation and study materials) are openly disseminated to the public, including by the means of Wikiversity study and research site.
The project improves Internet democracy and broader participation of underrepresented groups by allowing anyone to create his own XML standards.
The project develops free software: both specialized software for XML processing and general purpose software libraries.

1051,mintgate-token-gated-nfts,"Description

We believe every influencer and creator should be able to monetize on their terms. Too often creators are forced to monetize in ways that best serves the platforms, but not them or their communities. Social tokens can solve this problem, but first we need to make social tokens easy and accessible for anyone. 

That's what we do at MintGate.

MintGate is a platform that empowers all creators and communities by allowing them to create a token in less than 5 minutes. They can then give their token immediate value by using it to gate access to content. This includes videos, articles, NFT collections, chat rooms, video calls, and more. 

Tokens can be sent directly to any Twitter account, even if they've never used MintGate, and there are no gas costs. Gate tokens live on MintGate and any social media platform we support (we're adding more soon!) We give token holders the ability to mint their Gate token onto Ethereum or a layer 2 chain with creator approval. 

Because these tokens are not minted directly on-chain upon creation, anyone can use MintGate to experiment with their own token economy and mint onto their ideal blockchain once they're ready.





Token Protected Pages

TPP allows any creator to token gate any content on the web. 

Use token protected pages with a token you can create in minutes or any existing token. 

We support gating with ERC-20, 721, and 1155 tokens on Ethereum. We can also gate content with tokens on xDAI, Matic, Fuse, and soon Near.

This means if someone wants to access to your blog, article, design, video, album, website, or software they need to hold your token.

Try it now on https://www.mintgate.io/



What’s next

The current market is not offering creators a way to easily give their tokens value. Without simplifying the token creation process and giving it immediate utility we'll struggle to onboard the next wave of web2 creators. It’s the social aspect where we believe in community growth around the token. 

Minting tokens on any blockchain is the next step for MintGate. Tokens on MintGate are the perfect sandbox for testing your token economy. With this addition we provide you the means to take things to the next level by minting your tokens onto Ethereum or the layer 2 of your choice. 

If you'd like to learn more about this next step or just MintGate in general, you'll always find one of us on Discord.

4097,braidscience,"Mission: BraidDAO is building a decentralized science collaboration platform to fix the science publishing, review, and funding system. #DeSci


At braid we believe that the most powerful force behind human progress is human ideas. We believe the best ideas happen through powerful collaboration between independent thinkers. We believe that any idea — no matter how good or who came up with it — can still be improved.

That's why we're creating a platform for improving ideas — a platform where people can go to weave observations, insight, and reason together. A platform for anyone who wants to be a scientist, scholar, or simply curious.

The Problem with Science Publishing
Science is the systematic search to get ever closer to truth. Today, scientists use publishing papers to release their research results, seek feedback for improvement, and accelerate human progress. However, they face a huge problem: Publishers who hoard prestige, time, and money. If a scientists wants to get published in a name-brand journal like Nature or Cell: they face a slow and expensive process.

Today, Publishers:
Charge in the range of $10,000 for scientists to submit a paper to be uploaded to their website
https://twitter.com/NatureNeuro/status/1480909476546891784
Can take months to send the paper out for review (to reviewers who do not get paid) and then the authors HAVE to respond to comments (even low-quality ones) or their paper will not be published
Charge AGAIN for people to read the paper someone else wrote on their website

Tomorrow, Braid:
Will enable scientists to upload papers for free
Will create a fast, global network of reviewers and commenters to allow for rapid feedback and improvement
Will never charge to access a paper because we believe in free, open information

But why would a Scientist use Braid over Nature?
The prestige of scientific journals comes from their historic reputation of having great scientists publish with them, not from the name and not from the publishing company.

We believe if scientists are provided with a sufficiently compelling alternative to money-hoarding publishers they will make the switch. Scientists don’t like these publishers. We are looking to have a network effect of scientists bringing other scientists into braid and publishing research.

We believe we can provide a fantastic user experience. We are going to enable scientists to do things they aren’t used to doing on the old, outdated websites Publishers maintain.

For example, all science papers today get uploaded as PDFs. This is awful. PDFs are hard to read on your phone, hard for other scientists to edit or comment on, and a file format intended to be printed on paper.

Braid is a digital-first platform. We want to feel like using your favorite social media platform with the same level of collaboration as open source software. For Science.

We will enable scientists to easily share their favorite papers with others, leave collective comments, have a dialogue, and edit their papers right on our platform.

1261,web3-native-encryption-suite-w3es-by-guer-labs,"Introduction

A lot of effort has been put into building Web3’s decentralized infrastructure. Connecting to Ethereum and other services such as decentralized storage or applications relies on decades-old protocols such as TLS, which in turn require heavily centralized services like Certificate Authorities. This existing centralized web security puts web3 at risk.

These protocols are limited by their dependence on location-based addressing (IP). As the web evolved, centralized services and infrastructure emerged to compensate for the limitations of IP addressing. Most of these services exist to associate and verify identity with location. In addition to Certificate Authorities, these now range from multi-factor authentication schemes (e-mail, SMS), to cookies (validated devices). Each additional service adds attack surface and vulnerability, which is amplified by centralization.

Web3 Encryption Suite (W3ES) uses cryptographic addressing (ECDSA key pairs, such as ETH wallets) as the root digital identity for encryption protocols. This allows Web3 services and applications to circumvent vulnerabilities introduced by IP addressing while still using established cryptographic libraries and protocols.

Key Features
		
		- Digital Identity Verification using Smart Contracts, and Web3 services such as ENS
		- Secure key generation, using verified WASM/eWASM, or remotely in networked Trusted Execution Environment (e.g. Intel SGX)
		- Decentralized Key Distribution, via public blockchain networks
		- Support for Ethereum and SKALE (more coming soon)
		- Integrations with decentralized storage networks (IPFS, Arweave, SIA, Archon, Storj)

Encryption Services

Currently, the suite consists of three unique encryption services:

1. Single-party Encryption: Encrypting data with a unique key for storage on public networks, only retrievable using an Ethereum keypair. Possible use cases include validator data back-up, privatizing single-owner digital asset(NFT) metadata, and secured decentralized file storage.

2. Multi-party Symmetric Encryption (Handshake): Decentralized ID verification, key generation, and key distribution for symmetric encryption. Possible use cases include TLS connections, End-to-End encrypted messaging, shared access to decentrally stored files.

3. Proxy Re-encryption: Using verifiable, networked secure hardware environments (TEE like Intel SGX) to manage distribution of digital assets stored on public networks. Use cases include digital rights management, streaming music, limited-access to content.

The encryption code is originally written in GoLang, and makes use of Go-Ethereum’s crypto libraries. It is compiled to WASM for execution in browser, as well as compiled for IntelSGX.

Project Status

		- Encryption suite, compiled in WASM for testing, Single- and Multi-party
		- Decentralized Authority 1.0 Smart Contracts deployed on Ropsten + SKL Testnet
		- GETH compatible wallets via keystore files and local wallets
		- APIs with IPFS, SKALE, Arweave, ETH Ropsten
		- Basic Public Docs + Demos

In Development

		- Ethers.JS/Web3.JS Wallet APIs
		- Networked SGX Testing for Multi-party Trustless Keygen + PRES
		- Decentralized Authority Contracts v2.0
		- Additional APIs: OpenSSL, ENS, Opera/Brave, LibP2P

Project Status

We hope to transition this security suite eventually to the community in the form of a foundation-style DAO. Revenues captured from use will be used to support long-term maintenance and development, for both GUER LABS and community developers. Supporters, Investors, Foundation Participants, and Developers will use tokenized governance to ensure the maintenance and development of protocols over time.

Unlike SSL/TLS, it will have the financial resources and incentives to develop over time as Web3 develops.


WHY GRANTS?

		- VALIDATION: We’d love to demonstrate community support and demand for truly decentralized security. Give anything you can, and let the quadratic funding do the rest :)
		- AUDITS: We’re doing the best we can, but will eventually need paid experts to review the code base, from smart contracts to cryptography to compiler/memory vulnerabilities
		- FINANCIAL SUPPORT: We’ve put some serious time, resources, learning, and thought into this. We’d love the support to get it across the finish line.

Currently, Web3 software is still being distributed over Web2. We're fixing that.

We are building a secure, trustless software distribution system for both traditional and decentralized infrastructures. No need for expensive and centralized PKIs or manual code signing processes!

We support the following package types with our API natively, with many more in the pipeline:

Any arbitrary binaries (software, firmware, you name it)
Docker images
WebAssembly modules
NFT assets

The goal is to point any software distribution system at a Valist relay, which will ensure the integrity of the packages and act as a universal cache.

You can think of it as a trustless Bintray, or a universal Verdaccio, but with far more powerful access control and data integrity features. This includes multi-factor releases (M of N keys need to sign on some firmware before release), as well as the ability to use any hardware wallet to sign code.

3666,0xx-crypto-education-for-women-and-underserved-co,"0xx (Zeroxx) is an educational hub and community designed to help all women overcome structural barriers and start participating in the crypto and web3 space.

The women in our community are lawyers, therapists, media producers, moms, investment bankers, writers, acupuncturists, virtual assistants, musicians, teachers, chefs, and more…hailing from Spain, France, Colombia, America, Mexico, the UK, Argentina, Palestine, Czech Republic, Serbia, Canada and Brazil, and beyond.

Our community members have shared that the 0xx workshops and community spaces ""super-exceed expectations,"" that ""the feeling of self-empowerment is amazing,"" and that they are ""life-changing"".

Our primary offering is our free Crypto Class workshop with over 10 hours of live, in-class time, plus supporting pre-recorded sessions.

We cover topics including:
- Blockchain history and technology
- Decentralization
- Cryptocurrencies and tokens
- Wallets & Custody
- Operational Security & Investment Risk
- Web3 & the Creator Economy
- DeFi & ReFi
- Mental Health in Crypto
- Working in Web3
- Community Ownership & Governance
- And More...

Likewise, we are in the process of converting our entire curriculum and all resources into multiple languages because we believe the current crypto and web3 education landscape is western-centric. We are committed to ensuring women from all backgrounds have equal access to quality education and community support. We are collaborating with native speaking language partners, including translators, teachers, and community managers.

We are also engaged in various levels of discussion with other organizations in creating free web3 education for incarcerated individuals, refugees, displaced persons, domestic workers, and youth — all of which are examples of the types of projects our incubator may support in the future.

About this Grant:
Funds from this grant will support our continued efforts to create a more diverse, inclusive, and accessible web3 environment and assist us in continuing to offer free education for women worldwide.

We believe that without wide-scale web3 adoption that cuts across borders and socioeconomic classes, the new financial systems built in the crypto, web3, and DeFi spaces will not succeed. Success means these systems aren't just for people with access, but all people. We also believe that for wide-scale adoption to be successful new entrants must be guided, with clear education about all risks involved and having community support and *fun* as part of the experience.

If the average web3 user gets scammed, is overwhelmed, or intimidated, the space will become an insular, homogenous echo chamber. In our research, women have repeatedly expressed the need for community spaces that are thoughtful, compatible, and safe to learn and experiment within. 0xx has created a welcoming front door for folks to walk through, which allows them to appreciate what is being built, get excited and start contributing and building in the space. 0xx community members have gone on to work with various web3 and DeFi projects, contribute to and even start DAOs. 

It all begins with education.

Specifically, funds from this grant will go towards:
- Developing our programming on mobile applications (98% of women in developing countries access the internet via mobile)
- Aiding the development of our language programs - including outreach and assistance to local organizations to make sure women know the educational opportunity is available
- Compensating our translators, instructors, and community managers for their contributions
- Supporting 0xx project & operations managers

→  OpenNFTs: new version of the generic template 
→  OpenSlim : Slim version of NFT smart contract with minimal functionalities 
→  OpenPass : with the possibility to access services if you hold this NFT
→  OpenSoulBound : non transferable NFTs 
→  OpenProof : Proof of Something template, like POAP but non-SoulBound, not transferable
→  OpenCross : Multi-Chain NFTs, that you can Mint on one network and Clain on another one (also nontransferable for the first version) 
→  NFT audio and video minting


Architecture 

Kredeum smart contract Factory is developed on 4 layers (each layer developed on top of the previous one) :

→  1 st layer: a generic NFT smart contract where anyone can Mint, basic 
→  2nd layer: ownable generic NFT smart contract, that you create cheaply, and that you own 
→  3rd layer: ownable specific NFT smart contract cloned from a library of NFT Templates 
→  4th layer: multichain NFT smart contract, that you own on multiple chains 


Vision 

Our vision is to create a fully decentralized NFTs Factory, linked to an NFT wallet that anyone can use to view, create, share, exchange, and sell NFTs, and that can serve any use cases via the use of Templates. In order to fix the actual broken and centralized NFT market. 

We believe that if you own an NFT on a network, you should be able to own it on whatever other network. Your NFT should be usable in whatever Metaverse is available in one network or another…

____________________________________________________

Enzypt.io is a peer-to-peer file selling application we (Flex Dapps) developed in 2018.

The application encrypts your files and uploads them to IPFS, then allows you to share a unique link with anyone who may want to purchase them.

Currently, buyers send ETH directly to your wallet to purchase a file, so there's no way anyone can charge a fee. It's completely free to use.
____________________________________________________

Roadmap

We're aiming to augment the enzypt front end with some killer features, including: 

- Burner wallet for file vendor, using the Abridged.io SDK.
- File Previews.
- Pricing in USD instead of ETH, mandating payment in DAI/USDC.
- Permissionless featured items.
- Suave new UI.

Accomplishing these tasks will allow us to level up Enzypt by providing performant and feature-rich peer-to-peer file selling. Setting benchmarks for how decentralised applications should look, behave, and perform is a goal we take seriously, and the upcoming changes to Enzypt reflect this.

These tasks should take about 2 months in total.

2151,crypto4help-humanitarian-center,"Cripto Conserje Partners with South American Initiative To Support Venezuelan Refugees in Colombia with Bitcoin

Cripto Conserje has stepped up to help South American Initiative build a new facility in Cucuta Colombia to provide assistance for thousands of Venezuelan refugees entering daily.
Due to the political and economic crisis, these communities are suffering from life-threatening shortages of food and medicine. According to Cripto Conserje, best practices and uses of cryptocurrencies can provide economic stability to Latin America, particularly in places such as the border of Venezuela and Colombia.  
Cripto Conserje’s goal is to help Cúcuta, Colombia become the first city in the world to reach 50% cryptocurrency adoption. The team provides cryptocurrency training and support to refugees, street merchants, businesses, and now NGOs in LATAM. 
Together with SAI plan to demonstrate the use and ethical application of cryptocurrencies through the application of the knowledge we gathered in our field events where we ran tests on the use of the technology at the fringes of the internet. The new facility will be a place where we can work together to enable adoption through a crypto hub focused on the education of financial sovereignty. 
Every day thousands of Venezuelan refugees cross the border into Colombia in search of food, medicine, healthcare, shelter, and clean drinking water. The situation is dire as thousands pour into makeshift refugee camps struggling to provide the essentials.
SAI’s new facility will be a central location for Venezuelan refugees to receive humanitarian aid as well as education to help them get jobs and adjust to living in their new country. SAI’s focus is to provide assistance so that the thousands of displaced families can transition into Colombia and become valuable assets to their local communities.
Your Bitcoin donations to SAI can save lives providing desperately needed food and help for Venezuelan refugees in their deepest time of need. 

Regional Overview: 
Colombia is among the countries in Latin America with the highest trading volumes of  Bitcoin (digital asset).  Despite this high volume of trading, few businesses in the region accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. There are several explanations for this which include but are not limited to:
Lack of Trusted service providers 
Limited Knowledge Base and “Know-How”
Ambiguous  legal framework
The Venezuelan diaspora in Cúcuta presents a unique opportunity for these types of projects. Typical crypto asset volatility pales in comparison to the high currency inflation of the Bolivar. A decentralized system, that functions trust-free, is perfect for a displaced population that has limited access to financial services such as banking, savings, and credit. Our main objective is to align the right economic incentives to encourage self-governing communities and autonomous projects, as well as the right educational material and leadership to gain the interest of regional communities. 

Cripto Conserje strives to bring financial freedom to Latin America, a region comprised of more than 20 countries with a population of 650 Million people. The regional GDP represents over $10T, however 45% of the population is unbanked. There is a strong need for digital assets adoption in Latin America, particularly among Venezuelans who are suffering under one of the most dramatic economic crises in recent history. 

Our initial scope is a three-tier program to increase adoption in Cúcuta. 
Online Testing Environment: We will deploy an online test environment to measure the effectiveness of educational training and workshops. After participants and merchants receive technical training, they will take a simple questionnaire to measure the knowledge base and demonstrate a basic understanding of the technology. Once the questionnaire is completed, a paper wallet will be generated and automatically funded with cryptocurrency. 
Merchant Onboarding: We will onboard 100 local merchants to begin accepting digital assets as payments using on-site training and digital assets capable point of sales equipment.
End-user Adoption: After merchants are onboarded, we will work with them and local community organizers to distribute 300.000 paper wallets to people living in Cúcuta.  Individuals can use these paper wallets at participating merchants for food and other basic goods.

What Can and Can’t Timestamps Prove?
A timestamp proves that a message existed prior to some point in time; timestamps are occasionally referred to as “proofs-of-existence”. Being able to prove that data existed prior to a point in time is surprisingly useful.
A timestamp proves that some data existed prior to some point in time. OpenTimestamps defines a set of operations for creating provable timestamps and later independently verifying them. At the time of writing timestamping on the Bitcoin blockchain is supported, the format is flexible enough to support a variety of methods. 

Anyone could realize a timestamp with the permissionless blockchain by paying the transaction fees, for your convenience we offer calendar servers that perform this operation for you. These servers are free to use and they don't require any registration or api key.



And get the signatures or hashes to be uploaded to the bitcoin blockchain via their free calendar service.

The value of the merkleroot is calculated by taking all the transactions in a block and creating a merkle tree, shown here in this diagram from the book Mastering Bitcoin:



A timestamp proof in OpenTimestamps is just a list of commitment operations that are applied to the message in sequence. To verify the proof, all that needs to be done is to replay the operations, and check that the final result is a message that you already know existed at a certain time. Since every commitment operation is guaranteed to have a different result for a different input, there’s no way to change the message we’re timestamping without changing the result and invalidating the timestamp.

We have Done a one year of R&D process Studying the major Flows and Problems in Ride Hailing Industry and after working on almost 300 Different Datasets containing more then 10 Million Entries and Multi issue Stuffs we Have Concluded the problem First and Our Development and Problem Solving Capabilities Make us Always Proud. basically we Don't Have any competition in the market and we are not here to compete also . we are here to ensure the security and major Ride hailing industry concerns and that's our vision 


Problem 



The Ride-Sharing industry's a Tempting target for  many have sprung up around the world making bold claims about using  technology ( distributed ledger technology) such as  to give Drivers and users a great degree of control but as always they failed
Sharing a Ride with a  system is a big headache. Censorship and high-end user fair costs have made Ride Sharing so complex. 
Most of the  app due to  control is banned in multiple countries and cities. 
A  system containing big loop wholes in simulations and obstacles finding. Peer To Peer (Driver to User ) system is completely controlled and regulated by the big Hands 
Could  Ride-sharing apps with their promise of greater control on drivers and users topple the incumbent Ride-sharing giants like Uber and Lyft?
For the First time, Non censored,   easy to use Peer Peer-Based Ride Sharing Dapp is Introduced By FiniteYFI. 
                                                                   
Solution
Ridesharing is an important component of sustainable urban transportation as it increases vehicle utilization while reducing road utilization. By sharing rides, drivers offer free seats in their vehicles to passengers who want to travel in similar directions. Traditional ridesharing approaches are suitable for long-distance travel, especially inter-city travel, yet they are not flexible enough for short routes within cities. The aim of our research is to develop a service that enables dynamic ridesharing as part of sustainable urban mobility. Dynamic ridesharing refers to a service that automatically matches ride requests and ride offers on short notice without prior agreement between driver and passenger. We present the implementation and evaluation of a dynamic ridesharing service. The implementation part requires an automated matching algorithm that checks whether a driver can take a passenger with him without violating the maximum detour constraint he has set

 

FiniteYFI is one such app Built on Binance smart chain   
Completely Decentralized with no censorship control of big giant or third party behind. 
It's a decentralized net

work that enables riders and drivers to connect directly with each other Driver can get 100% of the fair without any cut of the third party. Driver self organize in Peer to Peer Guilds with Making Graph with an easy interface showing the complete immutable data tokenized using BEP 20 FiniteYFI (FYFI) they keep 100 % fares and charge low fares to end-users

Node Runners is a cyberpunk themed collectible cards game.
The action takes place in 2074, when corporate autocracy has gained total control over every aspect of our lives. Only with the help of honorable Heroes, who fight for the decentralized tomorrow, we can begin the battle and regain what’s truly ours.

Get your Heroes, upgrade them with Support cards, and fight the greatest Villains of the century. The freedom of mankind is in your hands!

What has been done already?
Our Heroes and Support cards are on sale. 90% of the ETH from cards sale is allocated to liquidity via smart contract. We have launched NFT staking, where users can stake their cards to earn NDR tokens.
Here is our NFT store: https://noderunners.io/get-heroes

What's next?
Our next development stage is creation of Villain fighting game directly on blockchain. After that we will proceed with the development of Player vs Player game mode, where players will be able to compete against each other with collected cards. Game mechanics would be similar to Hearthstone game.

How Villains are fought?
When fight is initiated, smart contract calculates the damage made to both Villain and Hero. With each attack player loses some NDR Tokens, as his health points go down. All NDR Tokens lost in the fight go directly to the second staking pool (Villains’ pool), which are then used as staking rewards.
Once Villain is defeated, player can claim his card. This is the only way to claim Villain’s card. Each battle is stored on the blockchain — your legacy will live forever!

L2 scaling
In order for you to have the best gaming experience, we have decided to upgrade our Villain fighting smart contract to support L2 scaling network. This will make our game more dynamic and accessible to a wider audience.

4125,ethelo-integration-for-gitcoin-and-daos,"Help DAOs harness some of the best digital technology for group decisions and governance. And create a new way for members to earn tokens  - by helping make better decisions!

What is Ethelo? 
Ethelo is a world leader in digital governance. Named “Best for the World” in governance by B Corp, Ethelo provides the world’s #1 ranked digital democracy platform along with a suite of expert services. More than $10B has been allocated using Ethelo by hundreds of governments, businesses and nonprofit organizations. Ethelo empowers communities to solve complex, constrained problems in a fair and democratic way. 


What is this grant proposal about?

Ethelo is robust and stable, having been tested in the field by hundreds of engagements over the past 10 years involving more than 100k participants. However - we are not Web3 native. We want to make the leap to Web3 and become a DAO ourselves. 

We need your help! 

We are offering the Ethelo tech and services to help solve Gitcoin decision challenges, big or small. We are seeking advice, developer energy, funding, allies and partners to help us support DAOs in using Ethelo tools in a web3 native environment.

Step 1: Onramps and Offramps
Our first step is to build integrations to create a seamless integration between Ethelo and Web3. That includes Metamask, Snapshot and more generally Gitcoin’s decision infrastructure.

Why is this good for Gitcoin?
There are many places where Ethelo can help Gitcoin with decision making and governance. For example, we can help establish a credibly neutral way of scoring and ranking grant proposals, to help donors identify the best grants to support. Check out some examples of how we would propose to do this:
Grant Discovery Design: Collaboratively design a process for grant discovery, including identifying key decision criteria, evaluator requirements and expectations, rewards and more!
Grant Evaluator Selection: Select a group of trusted individuals who are tasked with researching, understanding, and fairly evaluating the grant proposals
Grant Merit Ranking: Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of grant proposals, creating a ranked “leaderboard” of the best grant proposals in a legitimate and credibly neutral way

Learn more about our experience with granting with the Canadian government and others: bit.ly/ethelogranting

Taking DAO Governance to the Next Level
This isn’t just about grants or Gitcoin. Ethelo is a highly configurable solution to problems of decentralized governance generally. It has been used to find consensus for dozens of different kinds of group decisions, including policy, budgeting, planning, design, elections, conflict resolution and much more. 

Ethelo can be used to find legitimate, credibly neutral solutions to a wide range of problems - from big decisions such as treasury allocations and hard fork arbitration to operational decisions such as compensation and performance assessment. Our plan is to make Ethelo a key piece of the governance toolkit for all DAOs - and the crypto space generally.

Learn more: What makes Ethelo special? 

What comes after Step 1? 
Onramps and offramps are only the first step. In the medium and long term we want to release a Web3 SDK toolkit and open API for custom smart contract integration. Ultimately, we will provide an open source library of interlocking decision nodes and flows that can fuel what we hope will be a DAO revolution in governance flexibility and innovation.

The community started in Clubhouse rooms in November 2020 and it is now a cross platform community that amplifies the next global tastemakers in the culture. This year, the community was highlighted in Billboard Magazine's Change Agents List and NYLON Magazine. We have consistent weekly scheduled programming, curated playlists, NFT drop parties, onboarding sessions to Metamask/ENS/POAP, and panels featuring members of the community with major label presidents and mainstream international musicians. The community is active on Clubhouse, Twitter and Discord. The discord is a safe space to share music, NFTs, job opportunities, grants, events, manifestations, Web3 onboarding, VC pitching, and news related to international music, fashion, DeFI, and 3D avatars. The discord is not currently token gated, but once our tokens are minted, we'll create a way to make it still accessible but a hub to earn our tokens for contributing to the community and the culture. The community was founded by Melanie McClain, a New York based music industry industry alum. She is Black woman who has worked as hip-hop and African music playlist curator for YouTube Music, publishing A&R at Secretly Group, music experiential manager at Budweiser and social media associate at Pitchfork. She has worked directly with Lizzo, G-Eazy, Burna Boy, Roddy Ricch, Haviah Mighty, Lady Donli, J Balvin and more. Melanie is also has been a member of the crypto community for 4 years and active in communities like Bored Ape Yacht Club, Black NFT Art, FWB, Felt Zine, and Protein. A grant for Blurred Lines will go to building a social token economy for the community that ties into concert residencies in Decentraland, music and wearable fashion NFT collaborations, and IRL meet up events in Ghana, Lisbon, New York and Miami. The past year, the community has numerous examples of supporting musicians who have gone to chart on the Billboard chart and receive Grammy nominations like Tems (see: ""Essence"" featuring Wizkid and Amaarae). Plans for the community include meet & greets and custom merch for members of the community who earn a certain amount of tokens and building new products that help the needs to members of the community who have trouble claiming NFTs or minting due to issues related to data and access to wifi.

Feel free to import the libraries into your project, but beware that this has not been extensively tested. It is not production ready yet. Continued development will improve usability 

Zenbase is:
Decentralized, peer to peer
Fault tolerant
Offline first
Private
Realtime (Currently fixing this!!!)
Cross platform. It runs on browsers, and mobile devices. (Servers coming soon!)
Auth ready. Decentralized authentication is built in
Graph database
Persistent
Easy to use
That was a long list of super awesome features. Basically, Zenbase combines two awesome technologies: GunDB and Sia SkynetDB. GunDB is a Graph database based on WebRTC. Sia SkynetDB is a decentralized Key/Value pair database on a decentralized storage layer.
GunDB offers a flexible database, but lacks decentralized persistence. Centralized relays like S3 or a server are used to persist your data when WebRTC fails.
Sia SkynetDB has decentralized persistence, but lacks most of the features you'd probably want in a database (like relationships and queries).
Zenbase bridges these with a storage adapter for GunDB that persists data to Skynet.

EthKids.io version 2 is out there and appreciate your support on  Main Net launch!
The list of improvements:
drastically decreased the gas fees for donations
'passive charity' introduced - redirecting interest from Aave lending protocol for good cause(!)
improved token dynamics for CHANCE token rewards, inspired by Bancor formula
improved user interface
support for multiple NGOs - now joining your NGO in the protocol is ever easier

Introducing EthKids

EthKids is a protocol for charity donations with a rewarding mechanism based on the Personal Token Bonding curve.

Why
The idea is to appreciate regular donors for good causes.

How
The token mechanics make sure a small part of each pledge gets to the whole community fund when the actual donor receives some amount of a 'goodie' CHANCE token.
The amount (and the price) is following the exponential curve and grows while donations arrive

Benefits
The win-win for NGOs and donors are:
donors are appreciated financially and bound to the protocol growth
transparency of the funds
the protocol is a part of a global financial lego and raises funds via the integration with other protocols in the Blockchain space

2224,help-buidl-the-universal-wallet,"Today, we have a wide variety of digital wallets to store and access assets (crypto, credentials, NFTs, etc.), with more options coming into the market every day. However, each wallet represents data and capabilities differently, sometimes even intentionally to facilitate lock-in. What happened to bringing power (and public goods) to the people?

Carrying a dozen different wallets and having to use each one independently based on the situation is far from ideal. Current wallets are disconnected, leaving the burden on either the holder or verifier to request the required information for each transaction. The result is a cumbersome, and often expensive, user experience (not dissimilar to account and password management today). What's missing is a single standardized structure - a universal wallet - that can effectively point to and comprehend each digital asset in its current location. That's where we need your help!

The purpose of this grant (and evolving W3C specification) is to design an abstract data model and set of interfaces that approximate a physical wallet system and its common uses. There are many existing software systems which manage subsets or supersets of the information represented in digital wallets. This specification, and growing community, aims to bring compatibility to those systems by allowing them to continue to manage the information and interfaces, so long as they can be adequately described at the level of both data models and interfaces. Across a growing range of stakeholders (Transmute, MIT, Learning Economy, Mesur.io, SecureKey, and many more), we are committed to furthering this draft specification. 

True public good interoperability needs broad community support (and funding) if we're to realize the future we all know to be possible. Thank you for your contributions and for supporting OSS and public goods!

502,sos-childrens-villages,"Across 136 countries and territories, we're taking every precaution to keep all children, young people and staff members safe from COVID-19.

The alarming spread of the COVID-19 virus has led SOS Children’s Villages to take steps to ensure the health and safety of the nearly 70,000 children and young people in our children’s villages and youth programs, as well as some 39,000 staff members around the globe.

SOS Children’s Villages operates in 136 countries and territories, provides global and regional guidance on the virus to our SOS member associations based on the advisories of the World Health Organization. Local staff also follow the recommendations of their national health authorities to define measures to best protect children and staff that fit within their local context.

As a precaution, children and staff in some high-risk countries are staying within the children’s village, and visits from people outside the village and other facilities are restricted. In all countries, staff have been urged to develop and put in place Emergency Preparedness Plans for their programs and facilities.

The 10 SOS Children's Villages in China have adopted stringent measures to protect children and staff from the coronavirus. Children in some of the villages are doing their own awareness-raising campaign by making their own newspapers with messages about the virus and how to protect oneself (pictured above).

Our Approach
Our approach is better than short-term charity. In partnership with governments, NGOs and other relief organizations, we build effective support systems with lasting impacts for struggling families. These efforts enable access to education, healthcare services and employment opportunities that are essential to maintaining safe environments for children at risk. Our long-term services—which focus on making families self-reliant—include savings and loan associations, income-generating activities, child rearing classes, health education, emergency response and much more.

15,whiteblock-testing,"Whiteblock is a blockchain research and testing team. Some of our notable work includes our audit and analysis of the EOS blockchain, sharding p2p testing, which focused on libp2p, 1.x state related research, and a variety of other projects. 

We have been quite active in the space as a research and development team and provided services in this context, but have recently decided to shift our focus toward productizing our tool set and releasing the Whiteblock platform as an open-source framework. Rather than continuing to prioritize services, we believe it would be much more beneficial for the space as whole to provide the community with the appropriate development tools needed to test blockchain protocols and applications, troubleshoot, find out what works and what doesn't, and build better solutions.

Part of these initiatives is establishing a community around our methodologies and tooling. This strategy includes funding our own grants to encourage the use of the Whiteblock platform while helping educate the community in understanding the importance of formal verification and deterministic testing for distributed systems, specifically in relation to blockchain engineering and development. 

We will also be matching up to 100% of any fulfilled Gitcoin bounties in which developers answering bounties use the Whiteblock testing framework within the process of fulfilling any bounty. We will also be partnering with any projects and platforms who would like to solicit the Whiteblock team for testing or research purposes by building the appropriate OSS tooling and matching them on any additional bounties or grants so the community can fulfill these testing needs. In doing so, this will allow us to scale as a software-focused company while fostering the growth of a community of blockchain testing and QA engineers.

All proceeds from our Gitcoin grants will go toward helping us deliver on this roadmap, starting with our 1.x research initiatives, which means that we'll be directly putting everything back into the Ethereum community!

African Angels is a preparatory school which has been running successfully for more than a decade. We educate children who have limited resources and live in situations that are unimaginable to most of us. Despite their background and socioeconomic status, these amazing kids are determined to grow into educated, productive and responsible citizens. 
 
Many of the students who have graduated from African Angels have been accepted into, and attend, some of the most prestigious high schools in the country like the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls, DSG, Dale College and others. They have qualified for bursaries that allow them to access incredible educational opportunities and break the cycle of poverty they were born into.

253,sablier,"What
We're building the protocol for ""real-time finance"". Just like you can stream movies on Netflix or music on Spotify, so you can stream money on Sablier.

How
You lock-up some money in a smart contract, select a duration and choose a recipient address. Then, the contract starts ""streaming"" money to the recipient once every second.

Say Alice wants to pay Bob a salary worth 3,000 DAI over 30 days:

Alice locks-up the salary in Sablier
After 1 second, the contract will “stream” a tiny amount of DAI to Bob (around 0.0011574074 DAI)
After 1 day, the contract will stream 100 DAI to Bob, the remaining 2,900 DAI still belonging to Alice
After 5 days, the contract will stream 500 DAI to Bob, the remaining 2,500 DAI still belonging to Alice
At the end, Bob receives the 3,000 DAI, *if* Alice hasn’t cancelled the payment

See this short video for a demo and check out pay.sablier.finance to create your own stream.

We are constantly expanding the metrics we collect as well as the DAO platforms we cover.

While financial aspects of DAOs are fascinating and crucial, the heart of any DAO is its governance. As such, we dig into the inner workings of DAOs, exploring proposals, voting patterns, decentralization levels, and member activity and growth. We aspire to uncover all facets of the DAO, and love the exploration and dissection.

This grant will help us push our software forward. As the world of DAOs and governance expands with new innovations and ideas, we are adding more and more data, chains, platforms, voting systems, and DeFi protocols. On our immediate development roadmap are a new API, to serve the most data ever about the DAO ecosystem, and develop 1 million profiles of DAO and governance users.

2108,skyfeed-decentralized-social-network,"SkyFeed is an open and decentralized social network that aims to solve the problems that major centralized social networks are facing today. We don't want to force a specific client or feature on our users. We aim for interoperability with other projects by offering the most important features of different social media networks at once and using open standards while doing it. We also believe that users should own their identity and content and social networks should have no lock-in, data should be distributed freely and fair. We also think it's more relevant than ever because users are currently getting more and more aware of issues with the privacy and security of their data on major social networks.

We came up with a concept for SkyFeed which solves all of these issues:
It is fully decentralized using Skynet and SkyDB, so you can switch your portal at any time and keep everything: your social graph, your posts, and your reputation.
Your private key which proves your identity is never sent to a server, so you keep full control over it and don’t lose your identity when a Skynet portal is hacked (or all of them).
Private friends, saved posts and other usage data is only visible to you and stored end-to-end-encrypted, so data leaks can’t happen.
No central moderation, you decide which users and content you want to follow and see.
It’s 100% open-source (MIT license).

Currently, SkyFeed is available on the web and as a native Android App, native apps for iOS, Windows, macOS and Linux are already working, but not yet published.

SkyFeed was initially created during a 3-week hackathon in November 2020 and landed first place. Since then, we've been working hard on adding new features and growing the platform.

3104,nonce-finance,"We are working on a new model for NFT fractionalization that solves the issue of low liquidity and buyout mechanism for fractional tokens.
The benefit of fractionalization for an NFT owner is to make their NFT holding liquid, as well as potentially increasing the valuation of their NFT.
On the buyer side, it allows people to invest with small amounts by buying the fungible token in a single high value NFT or even an NFT collection. Fractionalization also allows NFTs to bridge over to the world of fungible tokens (via fractional tokens) where they get all the benefits of being composable with DeFi applications.
Fractionalization can’t be a one street though because if the NFT is locked forever after fractionalization, it loses its utility. For example, for a fractionalized art NFT no one would be able to display it in galleries in the metaverse. As a result, having some sort of mechanism for unlocking the NFT and making it whole again is needed. Having a good architecture for doing so would actually increase the value of the fractional tokens as well. We have designed a buyout rejection game and a flash NFT buyout option that solves this problem.

1508,spreading-crypto-education-through-books-in-less-,"Hello, fellow crypto enthusiasts, my name is Henri and I believe that education is the best weapon to liberate people, especially those who live in second to third world countries where poverty and corruption have ruined people professionally and financially. One of those countries is Albania, located in the Balkan peninsula with a population of 3 million people and over 10 million Albanian speakers worldwide (Albanian is a very special language, a lone, separate branch of Indo-European languages). 

Since I learned about Bitcoin and blockchain back in 2013 when I was 16 years of age, I have invested much of my time to understand it, which lead me to Austrian Economics and a new perspective of looking at the world through the lens of a sovereign individual. I quickly understood that Albanian people lack these views as they have suffered from one of the most communist regimes of the times and I became it my life's mission to do something about it. I am still a student and cannot afford to apply my big dreams of promoting crypto as a tool of liberation to my fellow Albanians. 

I became part of a meetup group as an organizer called ""Blockchain Western Balkans"" where we tried to build our community with our own funding and some sponsors. I published my Bachelor thesis which Introduced Albanian academics to Crypto-Economics and Bitcoin, I am writing my Master thesis which will talk more about Decentralized Finance and I do not want to stop here. 

I took a loan to translate ""The Bitcoin Standard"" by Saifedean Ammous and I am in the process of acquiring the rights of translation into Albanian. Can you believe that in our bookstores there is not a single book that talks about Bitcoin, Crypto, or financial freedom? 

What I am pursuing is a humble mission as I risk to lose more than to profit. In my country, you need to be always working to survive and I am lucky to have a family that understands my vision and supports me. 

I found GitCoin Grants after I took the loan for the book and I am going to translate it regardless if you, my fellow crypto enthusiasts that understand me more than anybody help me financially or not.
The more money I raise, the more I can afford to translate more books in my free time, Andreas Antonopoulos is next, Camila Russo, etc etc. 

Sadly, I am not a coder and hopefully, I have the strong will to also educate myself more on coding, but I think that these books will inspire the young Albanians to build future blockchains and technology. 
I was 16 y.o when I learned first about Bitcoin on the Dark Web. There might be a 16 y.o teenager who will get inspired by these books and could be the coder I aspired to be. 

If you made it this far I want to thank you for taking your time and wish you all the best in life.

1599,givestation,"UPDATE: We are live on Polygon mainnet. 
What this means - Users/Donors can now fund projects with Matic.

UPDATE: We have added over 20+ extra tokens in which donation can be done. Donors can now choose from the 60+ cryptocurrencies when they want to fund any project.

UPDATE: You can now join the GiveAgents (GiveDAO)



What is GiveStation?
 
GiveStation is a decentralized crowdfunding protocol that enables founders, teams and organizations to raise funds in cryptocurrencies while rewarding the donors for contributing.
 
 
Why we exist?
The crowdfunding community is too centralized and while the donors are being screwed for donating and trusting a project/idea, they end up not seeing the impact of their contributions. 
There is almost no room from transparency by default. This a huge challenge for every of the traditional crowdfunding ecosystem, and that is what we are here to fix.

Our mission is to instill transparency, reward and protect the donors while making sure that the funds allocated to this founders and teams are used in the right way without relying on the same old centralized entities.
 
 
How does it work?
To facilitate token donations and contributions from donors of the Polygon and Ethereum community towards builders and project owners, the GiveStation ecosystem relies, upon the straightforwardness blockchain has provided.

GiveStation’s rationale is encoded into smart contracts and other web3 innovations and that is why it requires next to no confidence in any individual or communities to function.  

The platform is not limited to developers and web programmers alone as we have made the platform available for everybody as long as they need funds to bring their ideas into reality. 

Any user can visit the platform, pick any idea or project they trust, contribute directly to this life-changing projects and in doing so, they get rewarded in GIVS token.

MVP: “3MILY”
ROYALTY DIVIDEND SMART CONTRACT for MUSIC RELEASE

tags: #media #music #ethereum #crowdsale #erc20 #dividends #OpenLabel #musicroyalties #fanbases #licensing #equitymarket #royaltytoken


*****


Abstract:

Musicians represent a process in a wider Music Production Chain.
They buy raw materials, in which we can include Instruments and Softwares. 

They out-source services from other operators (lessons, rehearsal rooms, recording studios, mastering studios, graphic designers, videomakers) in order to get out original content in digital format. 
Then, they pay distributors to get that finished content to streaming platforms, who then monetize again on listeners via Premium subscription and data collecting. 

Without independent musicians, musical instrument companies like Fender, Korg, Vox, Waves, Native Instruments and retailers like Thomann would have to provide Spotify, Apple Music & co. with nice, original, edgy, emotional and fashionable musical content, in constant flow and in large quantities. Possibly, provide an audience for it too.

Independent musicians deal relentlessly with such economic endeavor (averagely once a year) in order to get their content out and maximize the chances of collateral work like gigs, tours, participation to festivals (which have their own “break even” budgeting), hoping to get some sync possibilities or revenues from publishing, or simply to have attract more students, if they teach.

The digital format of music has thus become a capital intensive “utility” to attract other forms of work. 
At the same time, listeners and fans create the buzz about new acts, share their material, organize it into playlists, but their social effort is not rewarded by the streaming platforms they subscribed to.


*****


Background:

The idea of creating an “open royalty” crowdsale smart contract comes from a few very basic assumptions: 

Independent musicians should monetize on their releases or recorded music.
Every independent musician with a bit of career behind has a core-fanbase of people (10, 100, 1000) that follow him/her during live shows, share his/her content and from time to time provide opportunities and help with booking, logistics, videos, radio plays, any sort of stuff really.
These core-fans often buy the musician’s cds and merch, more in a supportive spirit than for actual use.
Royalties are the ultimate valuable asset a musician has a certain degree of freedom to monetize on.
Holding shares of a musician’s release (song or album) could be the ultimate incentive for fans to gather around him/her as contractualized participants in a “Open Label” scenario for a given song, album or catalog.
Authorities cannot forbid musicians to privately sell (part of) the ownership of their creativity, as far as it is certified and built on a verifiable mechanism that satisfies the sale’s agreement.
The combination of a PRO Rights Ownership certification, a contract’s wallet, ERC20 Crowdsale or Uniswap, a Dividend contract, IPFS CIDs and any basic html front end can easily allow that.


*****


“3MILY” MVP: Concept, Implementation and objectives

“3MILY” is the first single from my 10th album, written in a mountain retreat in Northern Italy one year ago and entirely recorded on a 4-tracks cassette TASCAM PORTASTUDIO recorder. 
I have decided not to put this release on Spotify and test something different instead.

Today the 21th of June (numerology is important to me) I have published a basic html release page featuring “3MILY” Videoclip, together with documentation regarding the ""3MY"" Dividend Smart Contract.

1000 3MY ERC20 non-mintable tokens have been created, representing the song’s 100% royalty pool. I have started an exchange on Uniswap and deposited the 10% of the total.
To spice things up a little, I have added liquidity in Livepeer Tokens (LPT), making ""3MILY""s first available batch of royalties dependant on the economy of one of the protocols I love the most.

In order to tie up a little the smart contract to the actual song, I have pasted into the contract's name the IPFS CID of the Royalty agreement (it costed me some extra ether, but it was worth it):
https://etherscan.io/token/0xd65cb247e2387b1c817433c5e1e74166bb31774e


*****


SCOPE:

I am aiming at implementing  a first MVP of a pay-per-exploit system, that could potentially integrate: 
1) Sablier protocol for temporary Licensing (synchronizations) 
2) Matic for pay-as-you-listen or pay-as-you-broadcast (web radios) micro-payments or 
3) a simple ERC721 sale paid to the EMYR contract for a life-time commercial exploitation of the song.

BODY Gallery wants to bring dance to web3, BODY is a space made for dancers by dancers, and puts its efforts in creating an economy that favours dancers instead of institutions.
BODY is creating a motion tracking studio in which dance NFTs can be made, and explore what theatre could look like in the digital era. 
Developments in motion tracking technology allow movement to be separated from the body and brought to the virtual world. By bringing technology to capture movement from reality, we will be adding a whole new world of customization to video games and metaverse spaces.
BODY gallery plans to educate movement practitioners to use web3 and NFTs as tools for their work and self empowerment. We want to work with artists that have made interesting and innovative work and give them an introduction to web3 and how it could change not only the way that makers create work , but also change how the economy works . For the first time in history, dancers would be able to receive a fair pay for their work .
We are pairing up with  renowned art institutions and art curators to bring artists that have big following in the art world into the NFT sphere . This would create a whole new way of thinking about an art object , and at the same time, by enlarging the spectrum of artistic work available in the space , make its value grow . 

BODY will become a hub for physical practice - by incentivizing our community to move, exercise, and take care of their bodies.

If we want to break away from the shackles of Cartesian thought, we must understand that our bodies and our minds are one and the same .

The motion tracking studio will allow dance practitioners to record their existing choreographies into digital information, allow partnerships and collaboration with tech people with artists , and be able to generate dance avatars , that later on users can acquire as skins and NFTs for video games , metaverses, online raves, and so much more 

BODY gallery is based in Porto, Portugal, which makes it very favourable to thrive as the Portuguese government welcomes crypto businesses . We hope to engage with local dance schools and studios and offer our services to the community, as well as engaging with these institutions to create educational programs

918,dai-card-transact-instantly-cheaply-and-securely-,"The Dai Card application, a simple browser-hosted wallet, allows users to transact instantly, cheaply, and securely in Dai.
Similar to a physical debit card, users “top up” their Dai Card balance by depositing Eth (or Dai) directly to their Dai Card address, which gets instantly swapped into Dai and represented as USD in-channel. Users can withdraw their funds directly into Eth without needing to pay gas, dramatically simplifying the “cash out” experience.
Because the Dai Card runs on the Ethereum mainnet in payment channels, user funds are always self-custodied and can be exited regardless of the hub’s availability. Integrating Connext’s system into custom applications is also simple, requiring only a basic knowledge of Javascript.
Why is it called a Card?
Just like a debit card, you can top up your Dai Card with balance and spend it everywhere through your day. We want users to think of that experience as different from but complimentary to wallets where you typically store much larger amounts and transact less frequently. This way, wallets can also easily integrate Card functionality!
Goals
We created the Dai Card for a few reasons:
To solve the difficulty of doing fast, cheap, stable payments today, in the simplest way possible without making too many trust concessions. By abstracting away the complexity of hosting your own payment channel hub, we’ve made integrating scalable Dai payments simple even for non-crypto companies.
To quickly collect user data on running a payment channel hub. Hubs require complicated operational logic to balance the cost of keeping lots of value locked up in channels versus the cost of doing lots of onchain transactions. The fastest way to figure out how to minimize those costs was to incur them ourselves; instead of experimenting with theories, we just built it!
To show the community what is possible with channels. Although payment channels have fallen out of the limelight in Ethereum lately, they are still the most well understood, trust-minimized, and stunningly effective scalability solution that exists today. We hope that community members who use the Card will be inspired to create their own projects using payment channels and hubs.
To take the first mainnet step towards building a fully decentralized, stable payment network. By hosting this hub, we incentivize ourselves to distribute our costs and risk ASAP. We also make sure that the backbone of our network is in Dai — which we believe is the best base currency for what we hope becomes the underlying payment infrastructure of the internet.

It improves transaction privacy by breaking the on-chain link between recipient and destination addresses. It uses a smart contract that accepts ETH deposits that can be withdrawn by a different address. Whenever ETH is withdrawn by the new address, there is no way to link the withdrawal to the deposit, ensuring complete privacy.

Now that we finished the trusted setup and made Tornado.cash v2 unstoppable, we can begin our work on much more convenient protocol (v3). It will allow arbitrary deposit and withdraw amounts and shielded transactions inside the anonymity pool.

TL;DR

PROJECT RATIONALE: WE BRING A WORLD BUILDING AGENCY ON-CHAIN TO DESIGN FUTURE WEB3  WORLDS AND DEVELOP FORESIGHT. WE BUILD SYNTHETIC PROTOTYPES, TO VISUALIZE THE FUTURE AND BUILD IT.
keywords: Future realities, web3 worlds, foresight, integrated storytelling, narratives, programmable institutions, digital assets, collective futures

THE CHALLENGE
One of the greatest challenges the web3 community, and the society at large, faces today is how to explore the transformational power of  web3 and how to use it to provoke change without falling short of its potential. Compounding this challenge are power centers with vested interests that drive technological development, the lack of any visions towards plausible futures that could map the path to follow, and a dedicated design research organization on-chain to follow through this task. 

HOW TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM
Using a world-building design methodology to construct future realities, we can explore the potential of web3 to its fullest extent. This is extremely valuable, as we can identify a number of different plausible future scenarios, explore what impacts they might have, and identify promising paths for technologies and applications. The world-building design process will help us develop foresight, strengthen the capacity of communities and their critical role as guardians of the web3 ecosystem, and shape its future.

👉Community-led, open-source design research activity that combines strategic foresight with systems thinking and design does not currently exist. 
👉There is also a lack of resources and incentives to fund this strategic world-building project.

THE SOLUTION: 

 🌐 We bring a worldbuilding agency on-chain to build Synthetic Worlds and develop foresight
Web3 Worlds Vision is not science fiction. Web3 Synthetic Worlds match language and narrative with programmable policies and digital assets. These prototypes create future realities because the starting conditions are anchored in the current state and they evolve based on the design of the institutions. What could happen in the future is based on what is happening in the present and how we program the institutions that will take us into the future. This is the world system that allows the world to function, evolve and grow.

🦄 Decentralized, permission-free, integrated storytelling
This project proposes community participation in the making of the Future Web3-World Vision to create many shared visions and form the future. 

✨ Each prototype produces outcomes across multiple platforms
The complexity of a futuristic web3 world is translated into a visual language that we can all understand by employing high-fidelity models, futures-based narratives, science fiction literature, art, and digital assets.


 WHO, HOW, AND WHY WILL BENEFIT FROM THE DESIGN OF FUTURE WEB3 WORLD PROTOTYPES

🚀 COMMUNITY
Develop foresight, strengthen the capacity and the critical role as guardians of the web3 ecosystem, and shape its future.
Foresight equips communities to align Web3’s future with their interests and leverage web3 to provoke desirable futures into existence.

🏄🏽‍♂️ ANONS 
The Future Web3 World Vision might lead to Science Fiction literature, TV series, film, art, digital media, comic book, or even the First City breaking ground in the cyber and physical world. Anons reap benefits on multiple levels.

🧭 TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPERS
A Prototype is a coordination tool to create a shared vision that can guide the development process and inspire people to take action. Envisioning these worlds and the novel possibilities becoming available, serve as a coordination mechanism to demonstrate how web3 can become a central component of plausible futures.

A long view of the mechanics. How things work.

Future Web3 World Vision.

WEB3 WORLD PROTOTYPES PROVOKE CHANGE
This project proposes community participation in the making of the Future Web3-World Vision to create many shared visions and form the future. The project will envision an array of city worlds at three-, fifteen-, and fifty-year time horizons starting from 2022. The project will explore possible future scenarios, integrating web3 technologies to different degrees and at different levels. Digital assets serve as part of the decentralized and integrated storytelling process, allowing participants to shape their scenario for the future, by developing the possibilities of web3. Members will gain access to an unprecedented three-year journey that takes place on-chain. They will be able to vote on key aspects of the project, including storyline and characters, and to help drive the ongoing narrative of the future.

FUTURE WEB3 WORLDS
Future Web3 World Vision looks inside deeply researched, wholly plausible future worlds, allowing communities to plan for tomorrow with the web3 technologies of today. The Super City of 50+ million people, a Climate-positive World, and a future reality where the entire population of a city is connected to a web3 system enabling cyber to physical world interactions through access to real-world data are some of the worlds introduced.

PROGRAMMABLE WEB3 HAS BECOME A FUTURE REALITY. ANY WEB3 WORLD WE IMAGINE WE CAN BRING INTO EXISTENCE 
Programmable Web3 can edit, re-program, and redesign components, systems, and interactions that make up social, economic, and political systems. ""Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of finance of unprecedented flexibility and creativity in less than a decade."" This demonstrates the disrupting power communities possess to use web3 systems within the online internet environment and bring alternative realities into existence.
By accessing data from the real world through a blockchain smart contract we can create combinations of physical elements and digital assets. With this new class of assets, we can create novel organizations, and complex policies, interactions and systems, that operate between realities.

SYNTHETIC WEB3 WORLDS
Web3 Worlds Vision is not science fiction. Web3 Synthetic Worlds match language and narrative with programmable policies and digital assets. These prototypes create future realities because the starting conditions are anchored in the current state and they evolve based on the design of the institutions. What could happen in the future is based on what is happening in the present and how we program the institutions that will take us into the future. This is the world system that allows the world to function, evolve and grow. With the world system, we can transition the future from one state to another.

This combination creates an unparalleled experimental environment that is novel and unique because it enables the design and testing of socio-economic and political systems, and of large-scale projects. Prototypes enable us to understand the consequences of proposed actions before they are put into practice. In doing so, they allow us not just to tinker with the status quo, but to dismantle it and build something better in its place.

A Prototype is a coordination tool to create a shared vision that can guide the development process and inspire people to take action. Envisioning these worlds and the novel possibilities becoming available serves as a coordination mechanism to demonstrate how web3 can become a central component of plausible futures. If we can show that web3 can help to create a brighter future and map the path to it, we will all move towards that outcome. Prototypes serve as a map of how to arrive at the future from the current state.

EACH PROTOTYPE PRODUCES OUTCOMES ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS
Using high-fidelity media and a visual language we can all understand, we can show people that other realities are possible and that web3 can help us get there.

PROJECT RATIONALE
Exploring the potential of web3 to its fullest extent is extremely valuable, as we can identify a number of different plausible future scenarios, explore what impacts they might have, and identify promising paths for technologies and applications. This process will strengthen the foresight capacity of communities and their critical role as guardians of the web3 ecosystem and shaping its future.

And yet community-led, open-source design research activity that combines strategic foresight with systems thinking and design does not currently exist. There is also a lack of resources and incentives to fund this strategic world-building project.

Because web3 is not a closed system, it does not offer reward mechanisms or token incentives to contributors in the way that blockchains, applications or L2s can. We will have to put in place a number of funding mechanisms to attract talent, sponsors, and the community.
At the center of this futures-design project, is decentralized and permission-free participation. The transformational power of web3 is too complex and daunting for anyone to tackle alone. In this era of unprecedented change, no single team or organization can begin to design unexpected solutions that disrupt conventional thinking without deep collaboration among ecosystem developers, communities, and local governance.
If we believe web3 empowers communities to design and form their future, then it is important to put in place incentives to attract talent to start working on the creation of prototypes and web3 worlds.

PROTOCOL MECHANISMS
The Future Web3Worlds Vision aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a toolset that includes: 
A protocol to ask for sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build the web3 ecosystem which gives sponsors exposure to the world-building project. Here’s a link to a project that inspired this protocol: https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
A membership token to enable the community to contribute to the project and reward participation.


Pilot 2022: The first launch
We’re running a 1-year Pilot to test our assumptions about this project and the process of operating it. To prepare for launch, there are a few tasks we want to complete appropriately:

- We are selling a membership NFT the $TINCAN Token to start engaging with the community. Read more in our first mirror publication here: https://mirror.xyz/phaethon.eth



The $TINCAN NFT: 
We are introducing the TINCAN TOKEN, signifying the Future Web3 World Vision as the container for multiple future web3 worlds collective visions and narratives. 
The platform brings talent and token incentives to create visions of web3 futures. Anyone can come to the platform and tokenize their interest in shaping the future of Web3. The $TINCAN NFT serves as part of the storytelling process allowing all the participants in the making of the Future Web3 World Vision to shape their own Super City and be a part of the story. 
Holders of $TINCAN will gain access to an unprecedented journey pushing what’s possible with web3 experiences and engaging people more than ever, with their favourite city. Each Super City world produces high fidelity outcomes across multiple platforms that are accessed as digital assets.


Our MindMap:



-TINCAN calls on All talented individuals and groups that want to use their skills and passion to guide the exploration of web3 and our possible future states. The call includes schools of World Building, Architecture, Urbanism, Foresight, Science Fiction, Design, and Cinematography.

With this initiative, we’re pioneering a way to fund the creation of the first decentralized worldbuilding agency and the continuous evolution of the Future Web3 World Vision through NFTs.

We believe that the way to do this is by building a decentralized worldbuilding agency that catalyses community-led worldbuilding experiences by operating at the intersection of:  
-Creativity, storytelling and art  
-Decentralized technologies and protocols  
-Digital communities, communities of interest, and communities of practice.

About the team
phaethon.eth, Founder

TINCAN TOKEN project started as a side project after PARIS CC 2017. I am an Architect doing Design Research in Urbanism and the cities of the future. I use the knowledge base of Ethereum to build new models using a new worldbuilding method that I am currently developing.
The idea that web3 is a terraforming system that communities can use to create societies that are like those in science fiction stories is an idea worth exploring. Our Web3 Synthetic Worlds model provides the opportunity for a unique and unparallel experimental environment based on narratives and complex systems. I am the founder of a design and build construction company with in-situ experience in large-scale projects.

yota stamou, Co-founder

Seeing the game-changing potential of blockchain technology, I decided to take a leap of faith and leave my job (after 25yrs in banking supervision and regulatory compliance) at a tradfi institution to jump into crypto full time. I am an economist building the future web3 worlds vision, inspired by the formidable challenge to provoke change by working with the web3community:
""If we believe web3 empowers communities to design and form their future, then it is important to put in place incentives to attract talent to start working on the creation of prototypes and web3 worlds.""

762,community-based-audit,"Why Community Based Audit

Decentralized blockchains is a great argument to make investors and Dapp users feel safe, but to our disappointment as security auditors we see on a daily basis that we are loosing this great feature.

Many projects centralize their decisions using function accessible only by few administrators with almost unlimited permissions. Audits are expensive and not all projects can afford one, the ones that do will not report to the community issues related with owner privileges. This issues can be solved by making community based audits since allowing the projects to do their own audits will always endup to be in their own favor.

An audit ordered by the community will:

Point out any unnecessary permission used by a project, this will help users avoid giving too much power to a centralized project over their assets.
Incentivize projects to avoid such behavior. 
If a security issue is found it will be reported to the team while coordinating with them to give enough time to solve the problem, once solved all issues will be reported to the community.
It will allow project with an active community to get free audits.
Help educate the community about security matters and sensibilize them to the risks.

How the auditors earn incomes in this model

The same way a PoW coin work, the value of minable coin is consequent to the minors efforts to mine a new block and secure the network. Miners are incentivize to sell at a certain price to keep their business running.

The miners in this case will be the auditors, after the end of an audit the auditors work will be reviewed by a manager that will approve their submissions quality and approve the audit. Tokens will be minted as a reward to the auditors and managers, token minting will follow a strict monetary policy implemented through smart contracts. 

How to sustain the token price

Auditors and Managers will be incentivized to sell their tokens with a price correlated to the amount of work that they provided, the same way as miners are.

The community will be able to order audits by buying tokens from the auditors and staking the tokens in an audit pool. Audit pools will be ranked following their total staked amount and executed in sorted order by the auditing teams.

Multiple mechanism can be implemented to sustain the token price, auditors work being the first. Another good example will be a vesting mechanism where the staked tokens in a pool will be released back gradually to the community. Other dapps can be built on top of this platform to provide more utility to the token thus more value, even a derivative market can be implemented since the staked token will be worth a certain value opening a way to new kind of DeFi projects. 

To simply understand this proposal everyone has to keep in mind the analogy between a PoW coin and the work provided in the context of community based audit.

Everyone provide an amount of efforts to keep the model running, and by building a strong community we will be able to incentivize projects to respect users, avoid scam and discover vulnerabilities.

Funding 

ICO model is most often not suitable for long term growth. This proposal aims to create a real value to the minted supply and especially not overestimate it, every token will be backed by real efforts made by the community, auditors or managers. Providing real work will incentivize to either sustain the token price or token price growth.

The funding will:

Help the project to kickstart and build a beta platform on Kovan network.
Hire developers and designer to build a strong ecosystem.
Bounty funding and audits (since without such platform we are forced to use a conventional audit process ).

1102,astral-spatial-data-on-the-decentralized-web,"At Astral we are building the location-based decentralized web. Our vision is for to support peer-to-peer, user-controlled alternatives to common location-based apps we use every day. We want new category of dapps and protocols that use spatial data to be open, interoperable and composable.


The Astral Protocol has three components:
Astral's verifiable spatial data registries - smart contract-based registries of spatial data objects like points, lines, polygons and raster images,
Verifiable location credentials, to serve as presence claims in the Astral ecosystem,
and Web3-native geospatial data storage technologies so the data backing these systems is user-controlled, cryptographically verifiable, uncensorable and permanent.

These are linked components that will enable the ecosystem to build a Web3 map of the world, and location-based dapps that use that map.

Astral tools and standards will be useful in a range of different use cases ranging: 
Metaverse / gaming: virtual land registries like Decentraland and Cryptovoxels, and AR games like Pokemon Go
DAOs / digital governance: geofenced local and regional DAOs, local currencies, spatial demurrage
Mobility: defining policy areas like congestion zones, capturing the position of connected devices like IoT and smartphones
Natural capital currencies: defining ecological zones, storing physical measurements of ecosystem conditions

Grant contributions will fund the development team building these public goods. Specifically, we are developing a Solidity library of topological and geometric functions, Web3 GIS tools and a mobile SDK to create verifiable location credentials.

Like all other stablecoins we realized early on that we require a secondary token that acts as a value support reserve and could be extended into governance and other features later on.

The Digital Bank (DANK) token is mainly used to support stabilizing the EUR peg for the PoC phase. Stabilizing the peg we rely on the constant primary market that always buys/sells DEUR for the current spot rate of 1:1 EUR. On secondary markets (like Uniswap), prices will fluctuate creating arbitrage opportunities that further improve stabilization.

At this moment, there are few direct expenses related to hosting the Ethereum communities, as because of COVID-19 all events have been virtual and we only pay for subscriptions like zoom and meetups (Antioquia, Bogotá y Caribe). 

But we hope that things get better this year (looking forward DEVCON 6) and we want to be prepared to be able to host local events, organize and sustain workflows, design community projects, and make some merchandising for the ETH Colombia Community.

For that, we are asking the Ethereum Broad Ecosystem funds to make the best possible community in Colombia, to promote the social impact of blockchain and keep incentivizing decentralized developments in LATAM and the Caribbean.

TopBidder protocol improves the ERC721 standard with an additional bid function. Any bidder can obtain the ownership of a rNFT as long as the bid is 10% higher than the last bidder. In this way, any rNFT has a natural self-pricing mechanism meanwhile compatible with the traditional NFT exchanges, thereby improving the liquidity of the NFTs and realizing the price autonomy.

Background

To the average DeFi investor, it is no surprise that since Decentralized Finance's inception we have heard every week or so about a multi-million dollar hack, scam or fraud. 

One of the good things about cryptocurrencies and blockchain is that it provides us with pseudonymity, therefore everyone is almost equally treated when it comes to a financial system, preventing authoritarianism and corruption.

Even though DeFi & Blockchain promises transparency, it is far from being a tangible concept. Even to the most tech-savvy people in the space, it is not an easy to task to identify vulnerabilities, risks and not to speak about machine code.

99% of Security Audit firms has become a marketing tool for scammers to deceive DeFi investors about the safety of a financial protocol. More than that, existing security solutions are static, unscalable and irrelevant in the long-term, due to the dynamic nature of smart contracts.

With the steady grow of DeFi hacks, rug pulls and other fraud, Arkhivist has been founded.

We are alumni of Elite Intelligence Cyber units, with Cyber Security expertise for more than 10 years, including major global achievements in the Cyber Security space.

Arkhivist's mission is to reduce security risks significantly, eliminating fraud while helping investors maximize their yield.

It is no surprise that our motto is ""DeFi Investments with peace of mind"", allowing our investors to generate yield, without worrying constantly about the safety of the protocol they're invested in.

We commit to raising and regulating the best security standards in the space, using the power of the community!

Our Solution

Our solution (in the beginning), will break into 3 major parts:
Predictive Risk Analysis - You can treat it as an ""Upgraded Security Audit"". It is a security audit, containing also behavior profile and other metrics to measure a smart contract's behavior in real-time
Monitoring Solution - Based on our Predictive Risk Analysis, our monitoring solution is able to detect anomalies and alert about them in real-time to investors, providing them a reasonable time to react.
Safe Investment Portal - We want to be a ""Safe Zone for investors"", meaning we will aggregate in one platform all of the protocols we have fully audited and are monitoring, providing investors with access to the safest protocols out there, making DeFi a ""Low Risk High Reward"" type of game :)

Progress

Arkhivist has been founded in January of 2021
Since then, we have managed to develop it's very first beta, proving potential capabilities in the long-term, if provided with enough funding and support. You can take a look at it here: http://beta.arkhivist.io/
We were provided with grant funding, as a form of support from DeFi Alliance and IOSG accelerator programs.
Currently, our beta is providing risk-intelligence only on the DeFi protocol 88MPH, on which we were able to catch ""suspicious activity"" about 2 weeks ago: https://twitter.com/asaforpani/status/1433383980770942980 , when no one else was able to tell it was happening, Arkhivist's technology has its eyes on the blockchain 24/7.
It's important to note that 88MPH alert we generated is not a rug pull so far, however, as security experts, we see it is an immediate threat to investors (described in the tweet), where our duty is to provide transparency on risk where there is none.
We are receiving great feedback from Institutional and Retail investors with regards to the usefulness of such platform.
Our plan is to raise a Seed Round in the coming couple of months, in order to develop the entire platform, hire work force and support as many protocols as possible.

1-2 Year Vision

Arkhivist's vision for the seed stage is to provide a platform for institutional investors where they could access a wide array of longtail ""high risk high reward"" type of DeFi protocols, and earn yield on it safely.

We believe that the main thing which could lead to massive growth of DeFi, is institutional adoption, which would benefit all of us as crypto early adopters.
Once product/market fit has been proven with institutional investors, we will have a solid foundation to launch a retail platform and release Arkhivist's token along with it.

We also are going to collaborate with the top insurance protocols in DeFi, in order to provide with lucrative insurance coverage to all of those who are interested.

The most important thing that we want to get out of this Gitcoin Round, is the support of the community, while getting the word out there, raising awareness about the most painful aspect of our space.

Long Term Vision

After proving product/market fit, we are aiming for the long shot.

We plan on releasing a Decentralized Security Ecosystem, with multiple key players that will make sure altogether that DeFi is a safer place to invest in!

The ecosystem will include DeFi Investors, Insurance Protocols, Security Auditors, Scanner Nodes, Infrastructure Providers and much more! All working together to make sure DeFi protocols are implementing best security standards, keeping the investors on the safe side.

This is the future of Security!

Arkhivist Beta

You can visit our beta here at: http://beta.arkhivist.io/
It is currently not fully functional and for demonstration purposes only, so use with care. It should give you a great idea on how the platform should work.

4027,ensme,"Update June 2022

Since first listing on GitCoin, we've been able to achieve so many things that wouldn't have been possible without support! We have migrated our servers to a more stable home and we've been speaking with a number of visitors about how to improve the site functionality.

I'd be lying if I didn't say that I haven't been able to update the project as much as wanted, but with the feedback we've had, we have a number of features on the cusp of launching; including email / push notifications for expiring domains, saved searches, regular newsletters and also ENS category pages for emerging trends such as Pokémon domains, 3-character domains, 0 - 9999 domains, etc.

These features should be launched within the month and will see a massive V2 version of the site land! To celebrate this we will be relaunching the Discord and adding more regular moderation to the platform.

I look forward to speaking with so many new and old ENS.me users over the coming month!


Introduction

ENS.me started as a passion project, striving to improve the visualisation and discoverability of ENS domains, whilst promoting shareability across dapps.

With the recent surge of onboarded users thanks to the ENS token airdrop recently, there is no better time to develop ENS utility than now.

After winning the recent ETHGlobal Web3Jam hackathon we've received extremely strong feedback from the ENS community and can see that there is a demand to bring more utilities to the ENS ecosystem.

The traditional domain infrastructure has extensive tools readily available and this leaves a gap where ENS needs to catch up. The first step in the ENS.me project is to promote the visibility, filterability and searchability of ENS domains to make the ease of entry easier.

Secondly I will be looking to tackle visualisation of ENS domains through automatically generated profiles for both individual ENS domains and also individual owners through reverse lookups. This will create a profile drawing live, style-able data from the chain and display something ENS holders will (hopefully!) be proud to share around their networks.

Thirdly (and finally!), by sourcing this information and allowing for styling customisations I'm wanting to expose ENS data and style preferences to other dapps with ease. Imagine, when a new user onboards you will instantly have all their preferences, access to rich media and colour preferences. Yum!

Roadmap

As we're coming to a close of 2021 I've put together the plan for 2022 and in my opinion it's really exciting! I also want to put some notes around what the Gitcoin contributions will be put towards moving forward.

2021 Q4
As we lead up to Christmas my main goal is to bring on a small team around the ENS.me platform to assist in product ownership and also support development. This will give us a solid foundation moving forward. Hopefully you'll start to see a small number of friendly faces in the coming week or two!

2022 Q1
The first two core pillars of ENS.me that we'll be wanting to tackle is Discoverability and Visibility. This is a more stable version of the platform initially created allowing ENS domains to be searched, filtered and monitored with ease. We'll also be updating the appearance of single ENS domain pages to better display information and expand on the rich content we can render.

2022 Q2
Once we have ENS domains being displayed we will start to offer ownership and customisations to the pages for the domain owners, allowing their pages to be customised and managed as they wish. The managed information will be exposed via IPFS to allow other dapps to customise their own experiences to your customisations and we will be approaching some key dapps as we approach this milestone.

2022 Q3 and beyond
As we start to see our community grow we want to become the defacto source for ENS domain visibility and with this, move towards providing the providing a key secondary market for ENS domains. Rather than just slapping a generic NFT listing up, we'll be focussing on accurate categorisation, displaying key metrics and tailoring the listing experience and UI to better suit users.

Meet the Team

My name is Tom Wade and I'm based in the UK. I've been a developer in the web2 space for over 14 years now with a primary focus on digital development. I've run a digital agency that scaled up to 10+ people but as I saw how the web for evolving and with the dawn of cryptocurrencies I moved freelance to allow myself to devote more time to the growing in that space. I've found it intoxicating in a sense, seeing how far it has come so quickly.

I'm currently a solo developer on the project and through applying for this grant it will help support me and my family whilst I devote time to the project, as well as start to introduce new team members as we begin to grow. In the coming weeks I'm hoping to introduce some new members to the team and will continue to update the grant as they emerge.

365,govrn,"We're fixing campaign finance and politics. Come join us.

What is Govrn:
Govrn is a new fundraising platform that gives you the power to hold politicians accountable to the issues you care about by using Outcome Based Donations. 

Outcome based donations are donations that your politician receives only once they fix the issues you care about (think kickstarter, but instead of the representative getting the money once they raise a certain amount of money, they get the money once the accomplish something you care about).
For example, if you care about climate change, you could donate $100 to your Congressperson only if carbon emissions are reduced by 2%.

Not only does this allow you to have political power, but it also fixes current campaign finance problems and reduces politicians reliance on big money donors. Essentially we're decentralizing politics be enabling you to become your own lobbyist.

Why this works:
Current campaign finance incentives are broken. Political campaigns are becoming more expensive which forces politicians to spend more time fundraising and ""dialing for dollars"" from big money donors (reports show that politicians spend between 50-70% of there time doing this and that it's the most hated part of their job).

By increasing accountability and transparency, Govrn enables politicians to spend less time fundraising and more time solving the issues you care about. By putting constituents and politicians on the same team, we're re-aligning the incentives in politics so that it's no longer a Zero Sum Game.

Gitcoin Grant Funders

If you become a funder, you can allocate your donation towards a specific issue that you want to see built first. 

We will use the total funding amounts each issue receives as an input for prioritizing the issues outcome based donations are first built for.

Current Status
We're currently building our prototype and launching a beta soon to conduct initial testing.

Omen is a fully decentralized prediction market platform built on top of the gnosis conditional token framework. Liquidity is enabled through a fixed product market maker which is similar to how Uniswap markets work. This means liquidity will always be available for users to trade as quickly as an ethereum transaction. Unlike Uniswap, fees will likely be higher and collected separately rather than being re-invested into the market liquidity, and also, the mechanism will be extended to support an arbitrary number of outcome tokens trading on one market.

Omen Prediction Markets are resolved via realt.io using Dxdao as the final arbitrator.


Why a Gitcoin Grant?

The project so far has been developed by Protofire and funded by GECO. The Dxdao has been discussing plans to host the project and is in need of some initial funding to help launch and maintain Omen. Separately, the Dxdao is also working on a fundraising initiative, which in the future should help sustainably fund maintenance and development of the Omen platform. The intent of this funding is to help bridge the gap between GECO funding and eventual Dxdao funding. It will allow the Dxdao to fund its members to take the necessary steps to deploy and maintain Omen until the Dxdao secures its own funding. The launch of Omen will also help demonstrate the value of the Dxdao and support said fundraising efforts.

202,vocdoni-zkvoting,"tl;dr
Vocdoni is a leading digital governance project that has developed a decentralized, universally verifiable, and anonymous (using zkproofs) voting system being used by hundreds of traditional organizations around the world. Today we want to take a step forward by continuing the improvement of our Open Voting Protocol and start a path towards the use of zero knowledge technology to facilitate the creation of trustless offchain organizations (or zkDAOs).

What is Vocdoni
The Vocdoni team is focused on meeting the governance needs within two worlds: on one hand we develop solutions and infrastructure for the traditional world, yet on the other hand, we create technology tailored to the Web3 ecosystem.

In the same way that zero-knowledge technology has already advanced scalability and security of economic transactions, we believe it is time for it to be applied to governance and make possible what has been impossible up until now: decentralized autonomous organizations with trustless and offchain voting.

We have therefore joined forces with a research guild that arose from the Aragon Labs and the Aragon Association to design what we believe is the future of trustless offchain organizations, or zkDAOs. This research should then be made available to the public, with a consequent implementation lead by the Vocdoni team.

Our mission
Create, promote and maintain a set of tools and infrastructure that empowers communities and individuals in the practice of governance and decision-making in a self-sovereign, neutral, transparent, open source, censorship-resistant and decentralized manner.

Our current status
We started Vocdoni in 2018 to develop a censorship-resistant and universally verifiable digital voting protocol based on decentralized technologies.

Over the course of 2018 and 2020 we developed a protocol and a platform to allow any organization to easily and securely use this technology. Vocdoni is now used by dozens of public and private organizations for elections, referendums, general assemblies, and other kinds of voting. In addition, we developed the first version of our token-based voting solution using EIP1186.

At the end of 2020, Aragon Association acquires 51% of the project. In early 2021 we develop the first version of anonymous voting based on blind-signatures. This technology was used for a non-official vote parallel to the Catalan parliament elections, using state-issued digital certificates for authentication.

At the end of 2021 we develop a new version of anonymous voting based on zkproofs and our API starts to be used by integrators.

In 2022, the Aragon project starts its transition to a DAO and, with it, the different team in the Aragon ecosystem moves towards the constitution of guilds.

As an independent guild, and in coordination with other projects, our team will continue developing the Open Voting Protocol and governance solutions based on zero knowledge technology. As immediate steps, we are working non-stop to improve our digital voting protocol for traditional organizations and build the new generation technology for DAOs (emphasizing the use of zero knowledge technology to facilitate trustless offchain organizations).

What we built
Open Voting Protocol: a universally verifiable and censorship resistant voting protocol. It enables encrypted until the end results, anonymous voting (using zkproofs and bling signatures), weighted voting, token-based voting and more. It’s built on top of different decentralized technologies (such as Ethereum, Tendermint, and IPFS).
Vocdoni.app: a governance solution that allows traditional organizations to organize votes with all the benefits of the Open Voting Protocol.
Vocdoni API: a set of definitions to allow third parties to integrate our voting technology.
Off-Chain CSP Census: a census approach based on Credential Service Providers allowing organizations to validate users manually using digital certificates, national id cards, Social Media accounts, SMS, Email and more.
Aragon Voice: a governance solution for gasless token-based voting on Ethereum and Polygon.

What we achieved
The first official and fully digital referendum in Spain was organized this year 2022 using our technology in the municipality of Bellpuig.
Our technology is being used by more than 600 public and private organizations, enabling tens of thousands of people to vote digitally using blockchain technology.
Our voting protocol is being used to enable DAO governance. We are dogfooding our own voting tool for the Aragon Network DAO.
We organized a project called 14Fruites, a non-official vote parallel to the 2021 Catalan Parliament elections which demonstrated the viability of digital voting for official elections using state-issued digital certificates.
During COVID our digital voting technology enabled the proper functioning of internal governance in organizations with between 50k and 200k members. Among them the largest cultural association in Europe.

What we want to build next
Transform Vochain, our special purpose blockchain designed for voting, from a PoA blockchain into a public Proof of Stake.
Implement a second layer of zkSnarks for receipt-free voting. More info here.
Implement the research done by Groupoid Labs and Vocdoni to achieve offchain trustless organizations. This will allow organizations to become zkDAOs using Vocdoni technology as layer 2 for building zkSnark proofs of voting proposal results able to be verified on chain in any layer 1 network (such as Ethereum, Cosmos or Polkadot). Whitepaper is out -> here
Keep improving our easy-to-use products and technology for filling the Web2/Web3 gap and bring traditional organizations to the crypto space.

💟 VideoWiki is a democratized, tokenized, AI-based immersive content creation platform capable of rewarding millions of digital content creators. Creators can come together to collaboratively to create media with complete contribution rights maintained on-chain and version-controlled without any centralized intermediaries.

It is a platform for publishing video content that can be automatically generated using AI, from text-based content. We aim to be a fully decentralized and censorship-resistant video publishing platform. An Open, Collaboratory Content Editing Platform that enables rapid Creation, Modification, Protection, and Monetization of Immersive Content. 


____________________________________________________


🎯 Problem to target:
The problem with too much Information in the information age: Digital Revolution empowered everyone to create free digital content. Increased data bandwidth allows streaming and this video content is being generated at a boggling pace, like conducting online sessions, video logs, webinar recordings. There is huge amount of meaningless data being created around the actual knowledge that needs to be preserved. 

🚀 Solution:
VideoWiki optimizes and adds engagement to condense the actual ""knowledge"" out of any form of ""content"", while making sense and structure of the data around us in the information age.

___________________________________________________


🟪  Videowiki has multiple content creation channels to create videos and publish them on-chain.



💜ROOMS
At VideoWiki, educators can launch meetings by generating and sharing a link for the conference. They can record calls with pause and play, post-produce these recordings (using AI), create breakout rooms, watch videos through external links, share notes and interact with learners in a white board live presentation.


💜 CAST
Cast.Video.Wiki is the place where users can schedule their events - being a private meeting with shareholders, or an international summit open for everyone. Here, the creator can schedule an event, which can be public or private, and in a custom online room.


💜CREATIVES
Pre-Production of immersive content: we use AI to parse any kind of content (text, presentation or weblink) to auto-create/auto-suggest a scene sequence for a video, the user is allowed to make any changes they deem fit. 


💜EDITOR
Post Production of immersive content: in case the input is also a video, the AI tries to split and contextualize the video in shorter scenes (breaks) which can be post produced say after a webinar or classroom recording to remove unnecessary bits of it.

$RBL is an BEP-20 token built on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain. It is the primary utility token and the token used when playing in an The Rainbowland Metaverse. It was launched in August of 2021.

$RBL is an ERC-20 token built on the Polygon blockchain. It is the secondary utility token and the token used when playing in an The Rainbowland Metaverse. It was launched in August of 2021.

Players will be able to use $RBL tokens to access exclusive experiences, items, perks, content and more within The Rainbowland Metaverse. These tokens will be given to the owner of Land & Estate a player is playing in, in exchange for the specific experience, items, perks, content, host businesses and more.

In future we will make the integration of the $RBL token with Land & Estate in such a way that nearly any in-game experience, perk, item or access to content can be created by Land & Estate owners and require $RBL tokens from players in their Land & Estate in order to access or participate in such content.

Additionally, $RBL will be required for purchasing optional, custom The Rainbowland Metaverse character NFTs, and may sometimes be required for unannounced global The Rainbowland Metaverse perks and content in the future.

1784,defisafe,"Existing problems: 

In terms of investment, profit & loss have become an unavoidable problem. Especially in the field of digital currency, the 24h x 365d transaction and unlimited transaction patterns not only bring huge returns to the purchasers, but also produce huge risks of loss. 

Our priority is given to how to provide the investors with better guarantee when designing our products. At present, some decentralized insurance products are available on the market, but some shortcomings still exist. Most products are suitable for minor probability events such as hackers and vulnerabilities. The process of filing claims is more complicated, and voting and other processes are required, so it is likely that the insured users which have incurred losses cannot obtain timely compensation. Compared with minor probability events such as hackers and vulnerabilities, DefiSafe chose a situation that investors are more likely to encounter: losses. Through DefiSafe, users who hold encrypted assets can not only enjoy the appreciation in asset arising from price rise, but also take lower risks of price fall of the encrypted assets. 

Solution: DefiSafe Protocol 

Defisafe establishes a risk capital pool based on smart contracts, by which the users can enjoy the appreciation arising from price rise, and share the risks of asset shrinkage in case of price fall. It can be understood as a dynamic economic game model, a game between smart contracts and the market. The contracts involve many possibilities. As long as one possibility exists, it is the victory of the contracts, and the users who have incurred losses can make a profit. Defisafe provides a convenient and open cloud-free financial market for digital asset investors. People can efficiently interact based on trusted codes of smart contracts, without relying on third-party guarantee entities. 

Our progress:
DefiSafe 1.0 has been released on the mainnet, and there is no public promotion yet. If you are interested, you can try it here: http://defisafe.net/

DefiSafe2.0 has released a testnet (Kovan) and is testing it internally. If you are interested, please let us know and we will transfer some test tokens to testers. You can try it here: http://defisafe.net/v2/

The project is still in the process of testing and improvement, and suggestions are welcome.

𝙏𝙖𝙠𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙥𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙞𝙗𝙞𝙡𝙞𝙩𝙮 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙚𝙙𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙪𝙥 𝙙𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙤𝙥𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩

When it comes to finding cures for age-related disease, there can be no compromise or delay!  Faced with the suffering and death from age-related degeneration of more than 100,000 mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters, every day, we need to WARPSPEED the development of cures for age-related disease. OpenCures takes on the challenge of speeding up every aspect of the aging intervention development cycle (below), from the discovery of an intervention, to the measurement of its effectiveness to ultimately the use of those results to inform the creation of the next generation of interventions.   


OpenCures puts the health technology consumer’s need as the intelligence at the center of the cycle. Our focus is to give consumers access to cutting-edge scientific assays, personal biobanking, ownership and control over their information and results using the OpenCures Platform (OCP) which is designed to store, analyze and share them. The OCP can already import numerous types of data, from PDFs from LabCorp blood tests thru acquisition of data from wearables and devices like the Oura Ring and FreeStyle Libre Glucose Monitor.   



𝙊𝙧𝙜𝙖𝙣𝙞𝙯𝙚𝙙 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙨𝙝𝙖𝙧𝙚𝙙 𝙘𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙯𝙚𝙣 𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙘𝙝

Using the OCP, individuals can create “group experiments” with the support of a clinical-trial strength platform.  People performing the same intervention can come together to securely and anonymously share protocols, charts and data, compare results and examine the aggregate for insights.  Any insight gained from the aggregate data can be federated and shared using blockchain technology, guaranteeing the provenance and immutability of the observation and its source while any insight that generates downstream value can be tracked and such value shared/ fractionalized with those who contributed to its creation.  

𝙊𝙥𝙚𝙣𝘾𝙪𝙧𝙚𝙨 𝘾𝙤𝙡𝙡𝙖𝙗𝙤𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙫𝙚

Entities who are able to participate in any part of the intervention-development cycle can become part of the OpenCures  Collaborative (OCC).  The OCC exists to create an in-silico simulation of human biology to use as a tool and allow the testing of millions of intervention hypotheses simultaneously.  These are entities who have agreed to work together in order to share in the downstream value generated by such a simulation and the byproducts of its development.  This would include software, devices, diagnostics, supplements and so on.  Tokens are issued for contributions to the OpenCures Database (OCD) and the entire value of the OCD is captured by tokenization.  These tokens can be used to support specific research projects, gain discounts for products and services, obtain “most-favored-nation” investment terms for start-ups enabled by the OCD and ultimately exchanged for currency under specific conditions yet to be determined.  When a token holder stops contributing to the OCD, the voting weight of their tokens begins to decline with time although the exchange value and potential remains unaffected. 

𝙊𝙪𝙧 𝙤𝙥𝙚𝙣 𝙨𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙘𝙚 + 𝙛𝙤𝙧-𝙗𝙚𝙣𝙚𝙛𝙞𝙩 𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙖𝙘𝙝

In addition to being a public benefit (a for-profit organized for the social good), OpenCures has established a charity to help in creating an open source version of the platform which is a major focus of CureDAO, also looking for support via Gitcoin Grants.   A commercial version will allow members of the OCC and beyond to work seamlessly together and share value.  

𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙬𝙚 𝙬𝙤𝙪𝙡𝙙 𝙪𝙨𝙚 𝙂𝙞𝙩𝘾𝙤𝙞𝙣 𝙛𝙪𝙣𝙙𝙞𝙣𝙜

OpenCures has been fortunate to assemble a highly-trained and competent core team to create the OCP.  We are working hard but we need to work harder and smarter if we want to minimize time to the availability of interventions.  This is going to require collaboration on a scale hitherto unseen in science.  In order to create this ""time machine"" we need more resources and partnerships to bring the different stakeholders, interfaces, data, and organizational structures necessary into the OpenCures ecosystem. 

We are making OpenCures as open and accessible as possible. From federated access, homomorphic encryption, web3 tokenization and blockchain support, integration with widely used medical data exchange standards, and “-omic” dataset storage  - we need funds to bring expertise to work on our platform to create an easy to use, standardized and integrated global resource for academic researchers to use for low or no cost while also bringing high quality human relevant biological datasets to industry so that drug discovery is more robust and has greater fidelity earlier in the discovery pipeline.  At the end of the day, our focus is to create positive feedback loops which funnel the right resources to the right place at the right time in order to minimize time to the availabilty of interventions. 

The funding from a Gitcoin round will be used to further develop these fundamental pieces needed to create the aggregate data sets and algorithms necessary to ensure aging interventions are developed and distributed as quickly as possible by rewarding those who contribute to their creation and distribution.

Pepemon started in 2020 as one of the new decentralized economies with a 99.86% airdrop of the tokens to the community members that helped spreading the word on our mission: build a blockchain game that it's owned by the players.

Since inception we launched different dapps in our economy including:
- Our staking platform with ~80% of PPBLZ token in staking or ~$3mil TVL.
- A NFT Store that sold more than $1mil of digital cards.
- A way for Pepetrainers to stake and evolve their existing NFTs in NFT Staking Events.


We have finalized our game requirements and have an off-the-chain prototype ready for everyone interested to try. We are currently building the web platform for Battle Deck building and contracts for duel on-chain.

I am Rosco Kalis and I work as a software engineer on various projects and tools in the cryptocurrency space. If you develop Ethereum smart contracts, there's a good chance you've actually used one of my libraries (perhaps without even knowing that I built them). 

I created the truffle-assertions and truffle-plugin-verify libraries, both of which solve important problems that developers are faced with when using Truffle to develop their smart contracts.

If you're not a developer you've probably still used Revoke.cash, a website that allows you to revoke your token allowances.

I've also recently released a generative art project on Art Blocks with my father, which is still minting, so an alternative way of supporting my work is minting an NFT on Art Blocks!



Read on for a list of the most important open source projects I work on:

revoke.cash


revoke.cash is a simple web interface that allows you to inspect all outstanding token allowances, so that they can be revoked or changed. This makes sure that you're not vulnerable to bugs in smart contracts that are authorised to spend your tokens.

ALLBASTARDS.COM


ALLBASTARDS.COM is a gallery view for BASTARD GAN PUNKS, a collection of NFTs created by BERK ÖZDEMIR by applying a GAN on CRYPTOPUNKS. ALLBASTARDS.COM displays the entire collection, allowing you to filter on specific traits.

truffle-plugin-verify
truffle-plugin-verify is a Truffle plugin that enables seamless Etherscan source code verification from the Truffle CLI. Before this plugin, verification was a cumbersome process where one generally had to give up on using Truffle for things like contract deployment. But this plugin makes it possible to automatically verify any of your contracts with a single command.
truffle run verify SimpleStorage --network goerli

truffle-assertions
truffle-assertions is an NPM library that adds several utility functions for unit testing smart contracts with Truffle. It adds assertions for specific smart contract functionality such as emitted events or reverts.
truffleAssert.eventEmitted(result, 'TestEvent', (ev) => {
    return ev.param1 === 10 && ev.param2 === ev.param3;
});

CashScript
CashScript is a high-level smart contract language for Bitcoin Cash. It is syntactically inspired by Solidity, and also features an SDK that is inspired by Truffle, Ethers.js, and the likes. This language has abstracted away a lot of complexity that used to be involved with developing smart contracts for Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. But if you're reading this and thinking, ""Why would I even want to use BCH or BTC instead of ETH?"", I've also written a comprehensive guide on the differences of smart contracts on those platforms.

Join us on our 10:10 mission to educate 10 million people in 10 years!

Founded in 2014, the Blockchain Education Network (BEN) is the largest and longest-running 501(c)3 global network of blockchain students, professors, and alumni. We provide our members with educational resources, workshops, mentorship, internships, jobs, travel scholarships to conferences and hackathons, and more.

Our team is led by former university blockchain club leaders who have gone through BEN and have come back to continue contributing to our mission. 

We are here to educate, and we define success as teaching our students how to contribute to the blockchain space, whether it be minting their own NFT, deploying a smart contract, voting in a DAO governance proposal, getting a job in the space, or even starting their own company.

Our BEN Learn platform is our coordination mechanism that will make this possible. Anyone can sign up, take courses, see our events, look at job postings, and join interest groups on BEN Learn. In addition, anyone can run a class using BEN Learn’s lesson plans - professors, teachers, club leaders, students, and community members.

We are aiming to provide free and open blockchain education for millions of people around the world. We need teachers, volunteers, contributors, and most importantly donors.

Each class on average teaches about 50 people and costs about $1,000 to run, including creating the lessons, marketing them, paying instructors and teaching assistants, administrative costs, etc. To achieve the 10:10 mission, we will need to host roughly 200,000 classes over 10 years. That’s $20 million a year to onboard 1 million new people onto blockchain every year.

Of course, we will start small but scale fast. For 2022, we aim to more than double our community of 7,000 students, alumni, and professors by onboarding 10,000 new people into the blockchain space through BEN Learn. In addition, we aim to host 24 workshops in-person at different universities, high schools, community centers, cities, and countries around the world. To do this, we need to raise $200,000. 


How to Support
Anyone in the community interested in supporting us is welcome to participate.

Every $50 is another student on-boarded onto blockchain, through classes on BEN Learn, our online and offline workshops, travel scholarships to blockchain conferences, and more!


Donors will receive many benefits, such as:
Ranking on donation leaderboard on our website.
Access to donor-only group-chats.
Regular updates on our students' progress.
Lists and descriptions of students in our network working on new startups and looking for investment.
And more!

843,dao-governed-eips-and-eth-20-spec,"Context

Hi there! we are working on The Underscore Protocol, a protocol inspired in GIT, but adapted to work with ideas instead of code.

The protocol is platform-agnostic and works with linked JSON objects that evolve similar to GIT repositories.

It can handle content from different platforms, including different blockchain networks. The integration with Ethereum is already done.

We also have a simple prototype of a content management app, similar to GitBook, but storing content on IPFS and governing it on Ethereum. We call this app ""Intercreativity"".

If you have metamask connected to rinkeby, you can check it out at https://eth.intercreativity.io.

What we will build with this grant

Our next milestone for Intercreativity is to have an Ethereum DAO governing the content in Intercreativity. 

Once ready, it can be used for storing and DAO governing community agreements such as EIPs or the ETH 2.0 spec.

Of course, it will also be available for any community that wants to decentralizedly store and govern any sort of evolving agreements and content. Think about social movements, expert DAOs or legal contracts.

<img src=""https://i.ibb.co/pvjDtXS/Eal-XYZy-UYAA918o.jpg"" alt=""Eal-XYZy-UYAA918o"" border=""0"">

We have already been working with DAOstack for some time now, and have some of the work needed to integrate their technology already done. 

The work needed to finalize this integration, and have a DAO governed Intercreativity space, is about 1 month of full-time dedication by an expert DAOstack developer, and it would require around 10k USD.

This would be enough to have a working prototype and start running some tests with the Ethereum community. To officially migrate out of Github, however, more work will most likely have to be done.

Rabbit Hole

Intercreativity has big (as in super big) ambitions :)

There is a single Gitcoin Grant this round titled: “DXdao's Panvala League DeFi Community Awards Grant”

All donations received during this round will go to the award winners.
***IMPORTANT***: Donations preferred in PAN.
Get PAN: If you don’t own any PAN, you can buy some at market price on Uniswap here or buy some using a limit order on Mesa here.

More about the DXdao DeFi Community Awards 
DXdao community will have a competition to nominate different open-source projects in the DeFi space that benefit the entire DeFi community across different categories.

These nominees were then voted on by the community including REP holders, DXD holders and other community participants.  

Are you wondering what you can do right now to support the open-source DeFi Community during the Gitcoin/Panvala round?

Stake PAN:  
Today, you can stake PAN to the DXdao's Panvala League DeFi Community Awards Grant, you can do so here: https://panvala.com/staking/
By staking your PAN (which allows you to hodl onto it), you help increase the matching multiple for all PAN raised.

Donate PAN: 
During the upcoming Gitcoin Grants round, donate PAN to the DXdao's Panvala League DeFi Community Awards Grant to support all of these important award winning projects and the overall community.

Get involved: 
This round had good participation from the DXdao community, but next round we’d like for the entire DeFi community to get involved and have a voice.  

IMPORTANT: 
Donating in PAN (instead of another token) gets Panvala League multiples of PAN matching in addition to CLR matching!

Note: You can also donate PAN directly to most of these projects in addition to the Community Grant.

Learn about PAN: If you don’t yet know what Panvala or PAN is, dive in on the forum or website.

487,locally,"The mission: 

Cryptocurrency is a highly technical subject. It is often out of reach to the average user for reasons relating to ease of use, ease of access to information, or access to technology. It should be as easy to spend one DAI as it is to spend one DOLLAR. During the Covid-19 crisis happening around the world, MKRDAI.info seeks to develop and host several virtual social / training sessions for new and experienced users alike to learn more and become further engaged with the ERC-20 ecosystem and the DeFi ecosystem that is based on the Dai stable coin. In addition, exposure to dApps and the practical applications they serve outside of the financial product realm is a priority.

We are seeking funding to be able to pay participants to participate in these learning sessions. A small stipend of 15-20 Dai per participant can make a big difference in today's economic climate. We are looking to use technologies such as Sablier and other innovations to highlight decentralized technology while providing a small contribution to fellow human beings who are struggling in the world climate today, as they participate in virtual meet up sessions.


Where we are now: 

This project is in it's infancy, however, the momentum is very forward moving and picking up steam. We are currently awaiting a grant award from MakerDAO to be able to fund two or three of these meet-ups that include a participant stipend.

There are currently two offerings on eventbrite for virtual webinars. One is a Bitcoin/Ethereum for Beginners Session: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/google-hangouts-free-bitcoinethereum-for-beginners-tickets-101889638652 the other is https://www.eventbrite.com/e/makerdao-101-dai-stable-coin-and-the-oasis-app-registration-101938877928 

These are not yet funded to stipend the participants. Stipend paying meetings will have a maximum number of spaces for ten users. It is important however that this project move forward to be able to refine and deliver premium and relevant content as we wait for grant monies both in the works, and via solicitation.

If you are unable to donate, we can still use help with word of mouth and re-posting these events where they might be seen by individuals interested in participating. Updates will be provided weekly at a minimum. Stipend paying sessions are expected to be added to the offerings on Eventbrite within a week or two. Updates will be posted here the moment that is the case. 

Developing skill level session content that is relevant and appropriate to users across the spectrum is a high priority. 


Where we want to go: 

Start providing stipend payments to Cryptocurrency / ERC-20 / dApp Webinar Participants - (Highest Priority)

Develop and offer virtual meet up sessions that apply to more target end-users, such as cryptocurrency naive, ERC-20 naive but cryptocurrency familiar - (In Progress) 

Utilize the incentivized participation of these events to develop analytics for dialing in world-class content as well as the most effective platforms and marketing campaigns - (To Do)

Until the COVID-19 crisis is over, the focus will remain the incentivization of ERC-20 / MakerDAO based learning meet-up for all. 

Conclusion

Although grant funding here has been non-existent to date, we continue to update the Grant regularly as well as assess the mission in response to the health and economic crisis that is happening concurrently to align the purpose to provide humanitarian aid and economic benefit first and foremost.

Aside from currency donations, help that can be provided includes:

Marketing Help - Passing along via social media shares or more formal and impacting, anything helps.

Networking Help - Are you personally, or do you know a stake holder in a major dApp or ERC-20 aligned offering that may be able to donate? Let us know so that we can send a proposal for sponsorship.

Presenter / Content Creation - Want to get involved and edit / create content or lead a session. Idea for a particular type of session? Please reach out.

Thank you for taking the time to read this Grant. ""This to shall pass""

2898,covering-the-first-un-climate-transaction-on-ethe,"Climate advocates are planning to use Ethereum for the first-ever Paris Agreement carbon offset swap this November at COP26, the major United Nations Climate Change Conference. We seek to cover this story.

Sludge is an independent, nonprofit newsroom focused on money in politics. Over the past three years, we've covered how the fossil fuel industry and Big Oil lobbyists influence climate policy. 

The Blockchain for Climate Foundation (BfCF) is a nonprofit organization that is building a pathway for countries of the world to finally operationalize Article 6 of the U.N. Paris Agreement on climate. While countries have adopted the goals of Article 6, an official U.N.-sanctioned platform for greenhouse gas emissions trading has yet to be created. 

Sludge co-founder David Moore recently interviewed BfCF founder Joseph Pallant for a piece about how Ethereum and decentralized technology can help scale up adoption of renewable energy in the power grid and through decentralized energy markets, hastening the decline of polluting emissions. 

There's a big story happening this year in BfCF's work that hasn't yet broken through to mainstream media coverage of the global climate crisis. BfCF has developed a beta version of “Blockchain Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes” (BITMOs), an Ethereum-based platform now on the Rinkeby network that will enable international transfers of emissions reductions—which the U.N.'s Convention on Climate Change can then move to recognize as counting toward the Paris framework's goals.

BfCF is working toward having the first-ever BITMO transaction on Ethereum mainnet occur at COP26, the major U.N. Climate Change Conference, happening in Glasgow from Nov. 1 - Nov. 12 of this year. In the lead-up, BfCF will be preparing leading U.N. countries that will be buying and selling BITMOs and demonstrating how the ERC-1155 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) document unique carbon offsets, creating a transparent and near-real-time global market for carbon reductions on Ethereum.

For this project, Sludge will partner with BfCF to produce a story series covering the lead-up to the Glasgow conference, reporting on how an open platform for carbon offsets can incentivize countries to invest in green energy—for example, by sending funds to another country to help build a solar farm instead of a coal plant—and how Ethereum and BITMOs are being used to guarantee the authenticity of offsets and prevent double-counting of credits.

As part of this series, Sludge will conduct and publish a series of video chats with members of the BfCF team explaining to a wider audience of viewers how blockchain technology and Ethereum dApps can help the Paris Agreement better document its progress for all the planet to see. The reporting series will follow the BCF team leading up to the first mainnet transaction and the next step within the U.N. to onboard more participating countries, toward the goal of dozens of countries using the BITMO platform in the next several years to meet their climate targets.





To ‘Electrify Everything,’ Blockchain Projects Dial Up Green Energy (June 15, 2021)

Sludge will distribute this special monthly reporting series over our website, email newsletter, and through republishing partnerships with widely-read news organizations. Our past climate investigations have broken news stories of the personal financial holdings of members of Congress in oil, gas, and coal assets. Sludge is a member of the Institute for Nonprofit News (INN) and The Brick House Cooperative, a six-month-old journalist-owned cooperative of nine independent publications from around the world dedicated to independent media and culture.

draft


TL;DR
The biggest pain point we face as web3 professionals is off-ramping our crypto into cash. We are faced with fees, long wait times, and multiple transfers to access cash. Like any other working professional, we would like immediate access to cash. Reap Exchange bridges this gap by allowing users to leverage their crypto earnings as collateral in exchange for a physical card with purchasing power. The cornerstone of our strategy is serving Dao contributors and potentially offering this service exclusively to audited Daos. We make money through securities lending and will offer rewards to cardholders through the staked collateral 



What is Reap?
Reap Exchange facilitates how Web3 professionals convert crypto to fiat so that they are better able to handle life’s responsibilities such as food, shelter, & well-being in the modern world. Our financial services allow Dao contributors and web3 professionals to leverage their crypto earnings as collateral in exchange for instant purchasing power.

Reap’s mission is to facilitate user-friendly interactions between digital currencies and daily commerce. Most importantly unlike virtually every other competing service which consists of a wide array of features that's only available to US-based customers, Reap the focus is on the rapidly growing global DAO contributor space that seeks to retain their anonymity. It enables them to leverage their hard work and allow their earnings to give them access to a financial system that empowers and rewards their dedication to web3.

Why Crowdfunding?
I am Ewart Orugagaii, a catalyst, and strategist at Reap Exchange. The intention is for Reap Exchange to thrive as a DAO that serves other DAOs. The goal with crowdfunding is to grow the team actively working on the project from one to 8 and to grow a waitlist of over 1000 interested members. With funding, we seek to hire 2x FT Developers, 1x PT social media marketers, 1x Financial Advisor, 1x Operations Advisor, 2x Smart contract Dev, 1x Project Manager, & 1x Document writer.

What’s Next?
Marketing Website
Prototype
Sow-Reap Protocol
Tokenomics Doc
DAO Partnership Outreach
International Bank Partnership
Strategize & Mint DAO

Why should you contribute?
Your contribution would help us break down the barriers that keep the next billion adapters of web3 from stepping into the industry. We plan to partner with DAOs to enable the empowerment of their communities. Dont have it right now? No sweat. Contributors can also come in the form of support, such as a retweet, signing up, or a share.

If you like what we are doing and want to help us achieve our mission you can donate as much you want via this Grant. All funds we get from this grant will go towards the development of Reap and building the infrastructure of the DAO.

Help us create software that will enable you, the builders of web3 enabled metaverse to avoid high gas fees, multi transfers, and days of waiting before you can spend your earnings.

During the last Gitcoin grant round, we outlined our desires to launch the final round of v0.6 in Q1 2022, as well as enable individual players and DAOs to deploy their own rounds.

We’re happy to say that we’ve achieved both of these goals!

Dark Forest v0.6 Round 5 - The Junk Wars, took place from February 18 to February 28, and we even launched it while in Denver for ETHDenver. This round saw a slough of new features, including Spaceships, Space Junk, and capture zones. This round saw nearly 2000 participants!

Shortly after Round 5 concluded, we launched a new feature that will shift the paradigm of Dark Forest.... Lobbies. Dark Forest Lobbies allow anyone to completely customize and launch their own rounds of Dark Forest for just a few cents worth of $xDai.

Our vision is for the Dark Forest gameplay experience to be built and freely modified by the community. For a taste of this, see the Dark Forest Community Plugins Homepage. 

ETH/ZK Education: We're also spending time on community and education initiatives aimed at bringing both Ethereum and zero-knowledge application development to more students and developers, including educational programs, starter repos and shared infrastructure, and more (to be announced on our blog in the coming weeks!)

Our work so far has been supported by a handful of one-off developer grants from organizations like xDAI, the Mozilla Builders program, and an in-game tip jar. Additionally, we are now funded by a new research foundation: 0xPARC. You can read more about it here.

We're so thankful to be a part of this ecosystem and we're excited to keep building for you all! :)

561,givedirectly-covid-19-response,"We’re delivering cash to families impacted by COVID-19 in the U.S.

We’re responding to this crisis by doing what we’ve done for a decade: delivering cash. Each household will receive $1k, and we expect the main constraint on how many we can reach will be how much we can raise.

We also plan to respond internationally, and are finalizing those details. Will share shortly.

We’re beginning by targeting vulnerable households enrolled in SNAP, living in the areas hardest hit by COVID-19.

In partnership with Propel, we’re able to identify vulnerable households on SNAP, most of whom are single mothers. We’ll begin by enrolling 200 households to receive the first payments and then expand, focusing on other populations in need who could be missed or underserved by other programs. We’ll update payment size and structure as we learn more about the need.

We’re doing this because we believe …

1. Cash is the right instrument.
You won’t be surprised to hear that from us, but to recap a decade of evidence and experience: it is fast, efficient, effective, and can have multiplier effects on the economy.

2. The government response will likely not be enough.
We’re glad that the government is considering direct cash payments, but even if it does as we hope, we expect there will be delays and not enough money fast enough to the most vulnerable.

3. We can execute well.
We’ve been giving cash since 2008, and have delivered over $150M to poor people in situations as diverse as Liberia, DRC during Ebola, urban Nairobi, and Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. When we’ve responded selectively to US crises in the past, we’ve seen positive results both in terms of immediate impact and longer-term interest in giving internationally.

4234,impact-x-crypto-masterminds,"Passionate about making a positive social or climate impact and the potential of crypto, but don’t know where to start? 

Already contributing to an amazing project, and looking to level up your impact by learning from and supporting like-minded peers? 

Join an Impact X Crypto Mastermind group of talented, hard-working people just like you, who will encourage and support you in achieving your Impact and Crypto goals. 

Know a rising star that would greatly benefit from this? Sponsor them! 

Why does this matter?

If you’ve been in crypto for a while, think back to what you were feeling just before you dove in. For many that I’ve had the privilege to speak with, this process took a lot longer than desired and involved a lot of normal fear and anxiety from joining a new community.

As open and inviting as many DAOs are, many incredibly talented people are not used to being listened to and speaking up and for themselves, particularly when you don’t know anyone. If we’re going to solve the enormous climate and social impact challenges ahead of us, we need to create mechanisms for EVERYONE to participate.

DAOs may have already made enormous progress on the structural barriers to entry, but there’s a lot more to do on the social barriers to entry. Let’s create systems, structures, and communities that are welcoming and accessible to everyone, no matter their background or circumstances.

How does it work?

In the days following the close of this grant, I’ll send out a simple survey to you and all the other contributors and sponsored participants to facilitate group formation. Survey will collect information about:
Goals for joining group, & what you can contribute
Current circumstances and brief background
Meeting frequency and timing preferences, and other logistics
Request to be paired with a friend, and/or to remain anonymous

Mastermind Groups of 4-7 people meet online according to their preferred frequency, and create a space dedicated to supporting each other achieve their common goals. Participants will offer you and each other new perspectives, resources, and connections in support of each others’ challenges. Maybe most importantly, you’ll be surrounded by people that know what you’re going through. They get it.

My role: An ICF coach is not a teacher; closer to a facilitator. Coaching is an effective method for helping people quickly re-frame, shift perspective, and redefine themselves and their situations. As a coach, I’m a co-pilot in the conversation, bringing questions and encouragement that draw out the very best contributions from the full group.

Vision: Where it’s going

This is just the start. While it may be possible to go faster or directly to the end, the goal is to form a community around common values of deep faith in people, community, and emergence.

If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together. 

Phase 1:
Launch onboarding & matching survey
Nomination conversations within suggested DAOs
Group meetings begin in January!
Launch Discord server for community to share learnings, experiences, and self-organize
Regular updates on progress here and via twitter

Phase 2:
Using learnings from Phase 1, fine tune sessions format and messaging
Roll out “coaching groups” where participants’ common goal is to prepare to host groups themselves
Roll out dedicated comms channels and people to support that

Phase 3:
Launch a DAO around the community, with the singular purpose of making Impact through DAOs accessible to everyone. Exact final wording and other details TBD by the community
Coaching and Mentoring matchmaking!

K tools blur the line between specification and implementation. The code is human-readable and a great reference for understanding Wasm and Ewasm, but it also generates a correct-by-construction interpreter.

We want Ewasm to have a specification that you can run your smart-contract with.

We have a prototype implementation of Ewasm that we have began using to verify an Ewasm contract with, which we are blogging about.

It is still early days, and right now we want to ramp up and make the prover more powerful, and the tools more accessible for early adopters.

In the next three months we want to get KWasm battle-ready. That includes:
Verifying a prototype smart contract.
Doing some major refactoring for readability and speed.
Making educational material in the form of blog posts and webcasts on how to formally verify contracts.

The community is supported by both Seaworthy Foundation, the non-profit social impact arm, and Seaworthy Ventures, the for-profit economic impact arm. Seaworthy Foundation (501c3) builds community and inclusion for ocean and climate impact innovation through accessible opportunities and education. Seaworthy Ventures leads regenerative blue economy development by advising and investing in our community’s co-created and incubated BlueTech (AKA ocean and climate impact technology) businesses.

On World Oceans Day (June 8th) we released our first impact report along with our ""Deep Dives"" - audacious goals that we know the Gitcoin community can be a critical ally for us in achieving:
https://www.seaworthycollective.com/post/announcing-seaworthy-s-deep-dives-for-world-oceans-dayimage



Thanks to our GR12 + 13 rounds, we were able to get our second cohort of startups up and running. Once again, the venture studio brings together a cohort of current and aspiring entrepreneurs (known as sea change makers) to either build co-created startups or grow existing ocean and climate impact-focused startups. Over the next 12 weeks, Seaworthy’s cohort members will have the opportunity to make catalytic connections spurring traction and collaboration, with access to Seaworthy’s network of over 250 mentors and collaborators, a community of over 2000 current and aspiring founders and operators, as well as investing partners with over $1 billion in assets under management. All of this leads up to Seaworthy’s biggest event of the year, its startup showcase happening in July.

The startups selected leverage the power of technology, data, and science to address challenges in areas such as coastal waterways, coral reef ecosystems, and the collection of environmental data. 

“From turning the tide on climate change and plastic pollution to improving coastal resilience and biodiversity, our second cohort brings together a diverse array of people and solutions expanding on our collective’s goals for regenerative ocean and climate impact. Our second cohort startups are scaling up reef regeneration, driving carbon dioxide removal, taking on plastic pollution (both upstream and downstream), and leveraging technologies from sensors to blockchain to create meaningful data and value. From Hawaii to South Africa, we’re excited to continue growing our global community driving regenerative blue economy development for South Florida and beyond.” said Daniel Kleinman, Founder, and CEO Seaworthy Collective. 

Seaworthy Collective’s venture studio participants now include:



More details on our second cohort of sea change makers:

Clean Earth Rovers
Based in: Cincinnati, OH
About: Every year our waterways are plagued by chemical and physical debris, leaving coastal business and cities to feel the effects of major pollution events. As a result, we’ve created a “Roomba” for coastal waterways that skims for the pollutants you can see and feeds you data in live time on the pollutants you can’t see.

Seed World
Based in: Kaneohe, HI
About: SEED is dedicated to educating others on micro-plastic pollution and the impact it is having on our world. We saw a rapidly increasing problem from our global mismanagement of plastic waste that had dangerous implications. Through technological development, educational programs, community outreach, and scientific application, we have set out to tackle one of the greatest threats posed to our ocean and marine ecosystems. We aim to plant greater SEEDs of change by providing the public and educators with fun and interactive lesson plans that build upon teamwork through S.T.E.M education. Believing that education is a pathway towards innovation, we offer our learning program to those inspired in taking their first steps in collectively solving our global pollution crisis.

ReefVitalize
Based in: Austin, TX
About: Reefvitalize solves for the current lack of access to coral restoration for anyone who isn't a marine biologist, scuba diver, or able-bodied individual by creating an activity that anyone can participate in in less than an hour from the beach. With a new technology and methodology for coral restoration, everyone can participate in ocean conservation with ReefVitalize. Our three-pronged approach will help restore ocean ecosystems, put tourism revenue back in the hands of local stakeholders, and create a regenerative, not consumptive, model for tourism activities.

Smartfin
Based in: Seattle, WA
About: Smartfin is developing an innovative ocean sensor for surfboards and paddleboards that uses IoT technology to connect citizen scientists with ocean scientists and decision makers to gather difficult-to-capture data in critical coastal environments for vital scientific understanding and protection against climate change.

SUPER
Based in: San Francisco, CA
About: SUPER® is a nonprofit, third party, tiered certification program which enables businesses to eliminate single-use plastics in their workplaces operations. Seaworthy will be working with SUPER to co-create a for-profit arm to help scale their impact.

Rovon Technology
Based in: Orlando, FL
About: RovonTech is developing controllable underwater live view camera technology for the consumer.

Lilly1
Based in: Miami, FL
About: Lilly1 is a carbon negative company that targets the upper layers to increase the alkalinity of the ocean rapidly therefore allowing it to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere. The company captures CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it safely in the ocean, a 100+ years sequestration solution

Capital Swish
Based in: KwaZulu Natal, South Africa
About: Capital Swish will manufacture high spec FNR (Fishing nets and ropes) compounded plastics for export globally, and for use in our own 3D printed modular on-water structures, which will fulfill our housing freedom and sustainability needs.

GR12

Gitcoin grants enable us to continue building the support, resources, and opportunities for sea change making founders and startups that are working to regenerate our ocean and planet. Thanks to our GR12 grant, we were able to attend the Ultramarine Summit, where we connected with and catalyzed collaboration among fellow leaders in ocean impact including Richard Branson, Fabien Cousteau, Diatom DAO, Oceanic Global, and many more!  The opportunity to be a part of Ultramarine not only cemented Seaworthy's role in driving an accessible, inclusive, and interdisciplinary future for ocean innovation, but also blazed the trail for many others to know that it is not only possible, but achievable, with persistence, dedication, and undeniable passion.  We were also able to attend Synapse Summit and were one of the 6 finalists for the award as one of the most innovative companies in Florida! 
Next in-store, we have our 2nd venture studio cohort that is gearing up to launch in April. We received 77 applicants and are looking forward to accomplishing and delivering even more than we did during our inaugural cohort.

Anti-theft backbone of carbon accounting. It could be used together with other carbon accounting systems to prevent all carbon to be stolen. It is the only carbon accounting with an anti-theft. Public goods economy, including carbon credits counting and retirement system.

Plan: Implement Aragon DAOs (on xDai) with holographic consensus. Payments for holographic consensus are to be withdrawn from user's account rather than just locked, to prevent voting speed more carbon than it saves.

Current drawbacks: I need money for smart contract audit. I also have some trouble to use https://github.com/ajsantander/hc because of bugs - this increases software development cost.

The project also supports receiving not only donations but also bequests.

Carbon

This smart contract is to be used as the backbone of carbon accounting system, e.g. for big (and small, too) carbon accounters (megalopolises, countries, all the world) interfacing with other carbon tokens, to combat theft.
Reward these who retire their carbon credits instead of using or selling them. Retired credit means less carbon production to save the life on the Earth.
Retired credit could be sold or used as a mean of payment.
My project creates and counts both non-retired and retired carbon credits.

Other

The main token feature is multi-level ""flow"" of tokens with limits of how many tokens may flow from one token ID to another in a period of time.
This multi-level system prevents theft as otherwise if just one of the several authorized parties fails it means that the entire system would be overflowed with big amount of fake tokens. My system prevents to transfer more than a certain amount of tokens, so giving time to disable the thief's account and his token.

Anyone can cheaply create his own token in my system either for carbon accounting or another purpose (like counting salary bonuses in a big company).
The system utilizes cutting edge ERC-1155 token technology, but provides also the old ERC-20 interface to it.

Reward Courts is an Ethereum blockchain (""crypto"") project allowing anybody to create a ""court"" that could reward anybody other (or himself) with an arbitrary amount of crypto. For example, it can be carbon credits.
The purpose of the project is to reduce world monetary injustice in its various kinds: The courts a intended to give money to someone who has less money than he should.
Users of crypto choose currencies of which of courts they use, so courts making bad decisions would be demoted and making good decisions would become influential.

733,notestream,"**ETHLONDON HACKATHON WINNER!**

Introducing NoteStream - private real-time finance.

NoteStream was born at ETHLondon 2020 (under the extremely catchy name Quachtli) where it won as one of six finalists and took home the AZTEC Protocol bounty for pioneering private real-time finance.

Real-time finance? Isn't that Sablier?

Sablier was a huge inspiration for NoteStream however there are a few use-cases where it is just too public to be a viable payment method. (For those not familiar with Sablier, it's a platform which allows a crypto payment to be spread out over time to the point of being a continuous ""stream"" of money.)

Sablier has a huge privacy issue which is inherited from Ethereum as a whole. If I know your address I can see your entire transaction history: who you've paid and how much. This means that if you're having your salary paid through Sablier, then the all of your co-workers, all of your friends who you've sent crypto to, and literally anyone who has ever seen your Ethereum address will know exactly how much you earn.

How is NoteStream different?

NoteStream is built on top of AZTEC Protocol, allowing private streams of money for which only the sender and receiver know the value.

How is this done? Surely the contract has to know how much you're withdrawing?

A private stream is made up of an AZTEC note locked on the NoteStream contract which only the stream recipient and sender can decrypt in order to read its value.

To withdraw, the recipient must tell the smart contract how many seconds worth of value they want to withdraw from the stream. The recipient then presents an encrypted withdrawal note along with this duration they want to claim for to the smart contract.

Using AZTEC, NoteStream can confirm that the ratio of the withdrawal note to the stream note's value is equal to the fraction of the stream's duration being claimed out of the stream's remaining duration. If the recipient is being honest then the withdrawal succeeds.

While you and the sender know how much you withdrew, everyone else only knows you drew X seconds worth of your salary without knowing how much that is.

Sounds great! Where can I try this?

You can test out the draft version working on Rinkeby at https://note.stream/ (You'll need to mint DAI or ZEENUS to test it out with.)

We'd love feedback or collaboration. You can find everything NoteStream-related at the repo: https://github.com/TomAFrench/NoteStream

What this grant will help us build:
Improving UX by reducing the number of transactions required to create a stream.
Ironing out any kinks from the smart contract / frontend
Improvements to privacy
Adding the option to refill an existing stream rather than needing to create a new one
Implementing user privacy to hide who you're streaming to (once supported by AZTEC)
and more...

What has been built due to this grant:
Implemented remaining ""core"" features ( e.g. cancelling a stream in progress) into UI
Support for multiple ZkAssets

3905,where-the-web3-rubber-meets-the-road,"A proposal submitted by Greens for Good, an open venture part of the Sensorica OVN. 
We practice material commons-based peer production (mCBBP) for the past decade. In terms of web3 development, we are at the end of the value chain, your experienced user.
We often hear that Blockchain has no material applications. Let's prove that wrong!

OUR OBJECTIVES
Bridge web3 developers with on-the-ground doers.
Provide a concrete peer production context and environment to test new web3 tools.
Help web3 developers build useful tools!

ECOSYSTEM
Greens for Good submits this Grant for the GR13 in collaboration with other open organizations, as part of the Reimagining Wealth Initiative. Our role in this ecosystem is to design and implement mCBPP models, in a real context of hardware development. Thus, we are moving material production in the p2p age. 
The impact generated from the funds that we will acquire during the GR13 drive will be multiplied within our Reimagining Wealth ecosystem by tapping into all the other organizations’ expertise and resources. In other words, we are planning to continue the development of mCBPP models infused with the p2p culture nurtured by TaoDao, disseminate the model in Africa with the help of Njombe Innovation Academy (Tanzania) and of the Best Future Centre (Uganda), and use ootopia’s p2p media for outreach. We will also refer our most prolific collaborative entrepreneurs to Carpe Verum for help to develop their own mCBPP initiatives.


ABOUT MATERIAL PEER PRODUCTION
Bitcoin is the first large scale example of digital peer production, a swarm offering a stable and secure token exchange service. Its design doesn't please everyone, but it demonstrates how peer production based on stigmergy works, moving away from central planning. We extend this new pattern to material peer production, to the development and dissemination of open source hardware. 
We believe that in the near future swarms of people will produce everything. But do we really want a future where swarms of people replace corporations?

How we handle material resources



WHY?
Modern life is global and we need to tackle wicked global problems. We only have two alternatives for large scale coordination, centralized platforms like Facebook or p2p infrastructures like Ethereum. In our opinion, the next century is defined by the antagonism between centralization and decentralization; between a new type of feudalism, where people are dispossessed of their means of production, and a p2p society, where means of production are shared among people.
-----------------------------
OUR VISION: Allow anyone, everywhere to participate in glocal economic activity.
OUR MISSION: Develop new tools to support material commons-based peer production (mCBPP).
We are an open community of practice. We invite web3 developers to propose new tools to improve how we do things and to learn from our experience.

VALUE PROPOSITION
We offer an opportunity for web3 developers to closely collaborate with practitioners of mCBPP. By supporting our campaign you allow us to free some time to spend with web3 developers and accommodate them to run tests of web3 applications.

We will gather a list of web3 developers from the Gitcoin community that are interested in developing IT tools that support mCBPP.
Train this group of interested developers into our model for mCBPP. 
Produce user stories
Help web3 developers write requirements for new IT tools to support mCBPP
Implement and test new IT tools that support mCBPP

THE PLAYGROUND
Greens for Good, a permissionless enterprise with the mission to develop and disseminate hardware solutions for food sovereignty and sustainability. It runs on seed funding, pretty good size community around it, great economic model to sustain it in the future.

Imagine a world without hunger. Is this possible in a world where poverty and hunger are systemic? We develop technology to extract proteins from indigenous plants or byproducts of agricultural processes, which we see as a latent nutrient capacity, to bridge current protein demand deficits or during catastrophes. To widely disseminate this food crisis solution, we embed the function of protein extraction into a more generic and extensible food processing hardware platform, which can simultaneously address various labour intensive and repetitive food processing activities (grinding, juice and oil extraction, etc.). This useful and versatile device will be adopted by local communities for sustainable operations, carrying with it the function of leafy biomass protein extraction, which constitutes a latent response capacity in case of a food shortage. We use the extruder design pattern, which is easily extendable to other applications and can be adapted to various economic and entrepreneurial models.

WHY US?
Greens for Good takes a CBPP approach to providing hardware solutions for food processing. More explicitly, the hardware is designed not as a commodity but rather as a commons. In other words, it is not destined as a product to be exchanged on the market, but rather as an open source, DIY device, empowering the poor & underprivileged communities, putting them in control of their food processing means. To sustain the adoption and the use of the Greens for Good hardware solution, we are also implementing an ecosystem of services to help people around the world find the design of the hardware, learn about how to fabricate it, use and maintain it. These services are built using collaborative entrepreneurship models. 
Greens for Good is part of Sensorica, the organisation that pioneered the open value network (OVN) model, which is our flavour of mCBPP. Sensorica came online in February 2011, and for over a decade has tested and refined its model. Many communities around the world have taken inspiration from Sensorica and many have written about it.

4048,just-dna-seq,"Upcoming event!
We are having the workshop 9th of June, 18.00-22.00, pls, register! Going to talk about personal genomics, longevity genetics, and gene investigation with Open Cravat. Reg form:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cb0pSPUlYWK8st-7aKY3dSjqytyPweKJZX2kMgkX7hM/edit

Who are we?

We are aging researchers and longevity enthusiasts who are curious about their own personal genomics.

https://github.com/antonkulaga - bioinformatician at Systems Biology of Aging Group
https://github.com/Lady3mlnm - junior programmer and volunteer at International Longevity Alliance and HEALES

What is Just DNA-Seq?

First human genome sequencing happened two decades ago and cost around 3 bln $. Today it turned from a great human endeavor to something that is accessible to all of us and costs roughly 400-800 dollars. 

So why bother with the DIY approach when there are a lot of personal genomics services out there already? 

For us, the main concerns are the lack of transparency, privacy, and, most importantly, room for customization - the content of reports is decided by service, your choice is limited with their product line. Results such services deliver are based on proprietary databases and algorithms. While having large analysis departments and a lot of medical data to base conclusions upon, their analysis is not transparent at all, in many cases you have no idea why they made this or that prediction. Verifying or comparing their results is therefore troublesome, especially when you get totally different predictions from many companies. 

More to that, what if we want to see how well our genes align with the prospect of longevity? For example, it is known that surviving until 90 years is more about lifestyle choices while living longer depends more on genetics, people with exceptional longevity are not distinct in terms of lifestyle factors from the general population [ https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03498.x ]. Unfortunately, there are simply no open-source or commercial offerings to address that demand. 

At the same time, all the information necessary to do your own analysis is out there, lying in the open generously shared by the scientific community. So, why not use existing open-source workflows developed by large academic groups then? Well, no luck here either! There are some great tools and we even build on top of them, but their output needs refinement to be understood by non-scientists. Moreover, we looked through the existing tools and did not find any that cover one topic very close to our hearts: genetics of longevity. 

According to the Longevity Variants database [ https://genomics.senescence.info/longevity/ ], there are at least 3144 longevity gene variants in 884 genes, while more recent sources mention 113 genome-wide significant longevity and 14 529 age-related disease variants [ https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.25.428082 ]. Knowing which of them you have in your genome is valuable information. 

In Just DNA-Seq we use OpenCravat [ https://github.com/karchinLab/open-cravat ] for variant annotations and prioritization and are working on extending it with longevity variants plugin. Overall, OpenCravat provides comprehensive but overwhelming (for non-professionals) results. To adapt it for our purposes we started working on the plugin to generate simpler personal genetics reports.



Project's updates 

Our Longevity report will include  several categories:
1) Your longevity potential - based on our longevity plugin; using it, You will be able to estimate how many ""longevity"" SNPs You have and whether its ""a lot"" or ""not so"" for Your population; 
2)  Major health risks and their management - it is not enough to have ""centenarian"" genes to become one: You have to cut down Your health risks before; The report will be based on available Open Cravat annotators, but with our filter sets in will be more user-friendly;
3) Pharmakogenetics of longevity drugs. 

Our longevity map annotator is already working and generating reports! But we still have some work to be done with variant prioritization and percentile counting.
 

Why a Gitcoin Grant?

This Gitcoin grant will be used to fund and speed up the development of the project which includes both programming and gene variants curation. This project is made by enthusiasts, which means devoting one's spare time on top of a day job to do more work. The downside is, of course, slow progress. We’re hoping to provide a financial incentive for freelance coders and scientists to invest their time because we believe having free personal genomics and longevity annotation tool will help everyone in the end.
With sequencing costs dropping further and further, more and more people will be willing to look into their genes. We want them to have a tool to assess the prospect of longevity as early as possible.

Why should you contribute?

Sequencing your genome is basically a one-time endeavor, it is not going to change over time, raw information can be reused, rectified, and combined with new data afterward. Analysis, on the other hand, gets old basically the moment you’re reading your report. Thousands of articles come out every year, understanding the roles, risks, and benefits of each and every SNP changes and improves along.  We plan to make a reporting tool capable of comparing existing scientific knowledge on longevity against your genetic data.

How to donate

3569,people-supported-intelligence,"PSi is an audio platform to generate scalable community-level collective intelligence.

PSi started in the web2 space to provide a scalable platform for civic governance and community-backed decision-making. We were part of Techstars Equitech accelerator and decided to pivot to web3, where we believe PSi can add the most value. We currently have a working alpha for PSi and are currently in a user testing phase experimenting with various DAOs, including Bankless DAO.

If you're interested in trying this out for your own DAO please head to our website to meet with the team today.



Why use PSi?
1. PSi supports DAO decision-makers to make community-backed decisions.

PSi redesigns online dialogue to better integrate perspectives, reduce conflict and align vision.
Existing online tools for coordination and decision-making can be affected by social biases such as homophily and polarization.
PSi reduces the impact of these biases by using collective intelligence research which shows that a diversity of viewpoints is the cornerstone of good decision making.

2. No other engagement platform uses voice for decentralised decision-making.

Thousands of people can have a real-time conversation to discuss a shared issue.
Voice conversations mean higher engagement and denser communities with greater social capital.

All existing online engagement tools are text-based (e.g., Discord, Snapshot). Text reduces the ability to communicate nuanced concepts.

Decentralized governance and shared decision-making require leveraging the distributed intelligence of people around the globe.

3. PSi makes it easy for everyone to join in and impact the decisions that impact them.

PSi is designed to make holding large real-time conversations easy so that even DAOs with thousands of members can seamlessly coordinate.

PSi consultations are efficient so they are sustainable and can course correct.

At the heart of PSi is the Pod. People are automatically randomly split into small discussion pods to deep-dive into the pros/cons of the DAO’s crowdsourced ideas.

Meet the Team
Our team has decades of experience in civic governance and collective intelligence. Georgie is a public sector leader with expertise in systems leadership, participatory design and team facilitation. Niccolo is a professor of Cyberpsychology at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who researches collective intelligence and group psychology online. Algoriddims is our web3 strategist and designer. 

Examples of who would use PSi:
A civic organization that needs to consult the public before a major decision.
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) needing a powerful off-chain decision tool to vote on proposals.
A medium or large business needing to harness the collective intelligence of their stakeholders to make strategic decisions.

599,proof-of-humanity,"Proof of Humanity
We are distributing the $UBI

A common problem on the internet is the lack of sybil-resistant identity systems. Users can generally create multiple accounts using different pseudonyms (or address in the case of crypto-networks) to receive rewards multiple times, bias votes, write multiple fake reviews, etc.

Proof of Humanity, a system combining webs of trust, with reverse Turing tests, and dispute resolution to create a sybil-proof list of humans.


Why this matters?

Similarly to the “double spend” problem, solving this challenge unlocks a world of unprecedented possibilities. Ethereum is currently dominated by plutocracies, or “rule by the wealthy”. We believe that Ethereum can go beyond, and facilitate universal democracy, “rule by the people”, and foster widely shared prosperity. 

Those possibilities used to be science fiction, but for the first time they are being materialized. Proof of Humanity has created the first democratic DAO on Ethereum, and the largest Universal Basic Income experiment using cryptocurrencies to date, with a monthly allocation to each member of the registry, currently valued at ~90 usd. It is already a key component for Gitcoin and other platforms for decentralized funding of digital public goods with Quadratic Funding. By offering a Sybil-resistant registry, we sustain the integrity of these platforms, averting fraud and collusion. 

All of this has been done in the past two months. But there's potential for much more. Proof of Humanity is set to create a new social layer for blockchain networks, which will enable a plurality of unprecedented dapps: credit networks with strong reputation systems, anti-surveillance solutions, peer-to-peer social media, shared economy applications, governance models using state-of-the-art mechanism design, and more. 

We are bringing the edge of political, economic and technological innovation in one single project. If we do this right, the sky is the limit.

Why do we need help?

Currently all maintenance, and most of the engineering work is being heavily subsidized by our partners Kleros.io, but this is a centralized and unsustainable setup. There are many possible paths forward: as a public utility there are several stakeholders who may support us in the long-term, and the DAO also has a treasury with ~3.7 million UBI which should eventually support workers. Yet, due to the fact that we are just getting started, the UBI token hasn't accrued sufficient value to sustain a team able to commit to the continuous development of Proof of Humanity. 

What we need right now is an initial push. In order to kickstart a fundraising effort to hire workers for the DAO, the Kleros Cooperative bought 46.48 ETH worth of UBI tokens from the DAO's treasury. This is already a great amount, but as we know the market for senior engineers is not easy and so far we didn't get many applications. We are asking for your support so that we can increase the amount set aside to hire workers. This will increase our chances of finding the right people, who will be able to commit full time and give Proof of Humanity the attention and dedication it needs, helping it fulfill its tremendous potential.

The UBI streaming is ongoing, you should join the registry too: https://proofofhumanity.id

232,raven-anonymous-decentralized-message-broadcastin,"Blockchain has enabled decentralized value transfer. A bigger future is privacy preserving decentralized information transfer. One unresolved(often overlooked) problem is anonymous message broadcasting which protects metadata privacy(who is sender, who is receiver, who send to whom, IP address, location, etc) against deanonymization attacks that opens up threat vectors impacting operational and personal security.  Raven is here to address this problem.
 
Raven is an anonymous message broadcasting network which is decentralized, censorship resistance, privacy preserving and scalable, anyone can broadcast messages anonymously without revealing message metadata. Anonymity is achieved by implementing Dandelion++ protocol on top of Libp2p. Dandelion++ is a messaging routing protocol that protects against deanonymization attacks. Libp2p is a full stack networking framework for building scalable peer-to-peer networks.


Use cases

1) Network-level privacy for blockchains (Ethereum 2.0, Cosmos/Tendermint) against deanonymization attacks in which network adversary links transaction/block/attestation to IP addresses and other sensitive metadata, thereby decreasing many kinds DoS threat vectors that rely on knowing IP addresses and the link to ID. 


2) Anonymous decentralized messaging for human or decentralized applications(e.g. whistle blowing, anonymous group chat, anonymous survey/voting)

So you want to decentralize... now what?

For TokenEngineering, tokens as an incentive and investment vehicle were in the center of attention so far. This reflected the need of most crypto projects aiming for a token launch, attracting token investors, and building first components of their cryptoeconomic ecosystem – or re-invent finance itself!

Today, more and more protocols and projects are entering decentralization, handing over decision-making power to token holders, to stewards with delegated voting power, or even joining forces in a DAO2DAO structure.

We’re facing new challenges, from defining the best voting mechanism to maximize community participation to fight collusion and fraud.
To tackle these challenges, we can draw from fields like Operations Research, Psychology and Decisions Science, Political Science, and Governance. We apply data analytics, ML, simulations and formulate accountability feedback loops as we are shaping a new social reality.

3173,specie-an-impermanent-loss-solution,"Specie proposes an impermanent loss solution that begins with dynamic/interconnected liquidity pools. Interconnected liquidity pools allow for liquidity in a protocol to act like a flowing ocean with walls set up in different paths to block or allow water to flow in and out at different times. Current liquidity pools act like siloed oceans with no connection at all. In an interconncted liquidity pool a user would be able to set up a connection to different liquidity pools an allow a rebalancing of his coins based on his own market making intuition. 


Simply said in contrast to Uniswap's V3 concentrated liquidity; a person could concentrate his liqudity at a certain price level on a curve and when that price level has left or a condition in the market has changed, his liquidity can concentrate toward a ""set of tokens"" that have been parametized to recieve liquidity at certain on-chain market making changing conditions. Allowing an On-chain parameterized interconnection of all liquidity pools in the protocol would replace the bad UX of adding liquidity and removing liquidity constantly to different pools. To simply choosing a connection to different liquidity pools and concentrating liquidity to parameters chosen by the user. This is a completely new innovation of the UX ofliquidity pools and completely different from the dual token liquidity pool rebalancing of Uniswap.

Limited Knowledge Base and “Know-How”
Ambiguous legal framework
The Venezuelan diaspora in Cúcuta presents a unique opportunity for these types of projects. Typical crypto asset volatility pales in comparison to the high currency inflation of the Bolivar. A decentralized system, that functions trust-free, is perfect for a displaced population that has limited access to financial services such as banking, savings, and credit. Our main objective is to align the right economic incentives to encourage self-governing communities and autonomous projects, as well as the right educational material and leadership to gain the interest of regional communities. 

Cripto Conserje strives to bring financial freedom to Latin America, a region comprised of more than 20 countries with a population of 650 Million people. The regional GDP represents over $10T, however 45% of the population is unbanked. There is a strong need for digital assets adoption in Latin America, particularly among Venezuelans who are suffering under one of the most dramatic economic crises in recent history. 

Our initial scope is a three-tier program to increase adoption in Cúcuta. 
Online Testing Environment: We will deploy an online test environment to measure the effectiveness of educational training and workshops. After participants and merchants receive technical training, they will take a simple questionnaire to measure the knowledge base and demonstrate a basic understanding of the technology. Once the questionnaire is completed, a paper wallet will be generated and automatically funded with cryptocurrency. 
Merchant Onboarding: We will onboard 100 local merchants to begin accepting digital assets as payments using on-site training and digital assets capable point of sales tools.
End-user Adoption: After merchants are onboarded, we will work with them and local community organizers to distribute 300.000 paper wallets to people living in Cúcuta. Individuals can use these paper wallets at participating merchants for food and other basic goods.



Cripto Conserje has been in operation since April of 2018. We have conducted eight successful training workshops with merchants, paper wallets and different point of sales. We are one of the few projects tackling this problem with local team leads on the ground. We are currently at the second tier of our project.  

Digital assets can provide economic stability throughout Latin America, particularly in places such as Venezuela where communities are suffering from severe shortages of food and medicine. Our vision is to achieve 50% crypto adoption in major cities like Bogota, Mexico City, and Buenos Aires.

We report the results of our events and also record videos of the event in progress before the data are in, so that we can be accountable for the results. We also run smaller, non-experimental tests to learn more about what works best and how different types of recipients spend funds they receive. This was how we began our project with 2 paper wallets and an informal merchant.

Scaling 

To measure our progress and scalability, we have set short term and long term project milestones:

1. Short term milestones
Launch Crypto Education Hub in Cúcuta. In partnership with South American Initiative, Cripto Conserje has acquired land to build a community center near Cúcuta. 
Complete Merchant Adoption pilot program, targeting 100 participating merchants.
Improve Testing environment and questionnaires with enhanced features such as automatic reward system based on user experience and knowledge base acquired.
Offer financial access via SMS by 3rd party service provider CoinTigo.io (see Key Partners for more details).
Create educational material; training videos and in-site programs / fast-tracks
Advertising and Marketing.
Live support and online helpdesk for crypto asset management.
Repeat model with merchants outside of Cúcuta.
2. Long term milestones
Achieve +50% crypto adoption in a major city in Latin America
Provide support and aid to economically distressed populations living in Cúcuta, Colombia, especially Venezuelan refugees
Prove crypto currencies are a workable form of digital money
Establish a successful and safe business operation that is can be easily replicated
Future services include:
Help Desk for clients and merchants (regarding issues with wallets, exchanges, etc…)
Consulting and continued education (such as crypto asset management courses, walking the client through things like staking, masternodes, and automated trading such as index strategies, lending, etc.)
Fiat Exchanges as a service at POS



Impact

Venezuela is experiencing hyperinflation and deep economic crisis. It has gotten itself blocked from the capital markets, and refuses to let in humanitarian aid. When access to West Berlin was blocked in 1948, rather than passively watching and letting the city struggle for basic necessities, the Western Allies responded by peacefully dropping supplies to the citizens. Now, 70 years later, our vision is to airdrop sound money to Venezuelans that they could use to freely trade between them, exchange it for other currencies, and import basic supplies from abroad.

About 1.5+ million Venezuelan refugees live in Colombia. We’re looking to raise $3 million worth of bitcoin from philanthropists and the crypto community – particularly unconditional cash transfer advocates like Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong.

Most of the money will be deposited in cryptocurrency wallets, one for every Venezuelan refugee we can reach via sms or at our educational events with paper wallets. We will guard the addresses’ private keys and schedule on-chain deposits of about $5-10 per address, at times when the network fees are the lowest. Once 50 partner merchants have been set up, we could theoretically seed 100,000 addresses in the first four months at a cost of about 70 BTC, worth around $500,000 today. This means we would need to scale our efforts to more than 800 people per day. To do this our partner merchants would double as our trainers, using this approach each merchant could train 20 people per day on our behalf. The education hub could comfortably host the balance of the 100,000 not reached by our merchants.

When economic disasters strike, individuals have their own personal emergencies. Whether it’s leaving their home country, being unable to earn enough and pay the bills, or needing to purchase medicine, each person has their own unique challenges. These needs are difficult to predict. Our vision is to teach refugees how to use crypto and incentivize merchants to accept it.
Imagine instead of getting a pile of used clothes you were given $5 no strings attached. All our participants have to do is learn how to use this new form of cash. We recognize that everyone has unique emergencies and it is unrealistic to expect aid organizations to predict the wide array of complex needs that arise. Instead, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies allows recipients to prioritize and solve their own challenges.


The impact will be to help Venezuelan refugees in Cúcuta, Colombia.. We will educate people in Cúcuta and generate sustainable economic activity.
Once participants are trained to understand and use cryptocurrency, we will offer vocational training programs to learn skills like micro-farming and digital media production. We will connect them with employment opportunities that will allow them to earn enough Bitcoin or other liquid digital assets to purchase food and basic supplies for themselves and their families.
Once participants are trained to understand and use cryptocurrency, they will have more tools and resources to protect against hyperinflation or other fiscally harmful circumstances that impede them from economic activity.
Educated and trained Venezuelans will be a valuable asset to Colombia because they will have the skills to help build a better, more prosperous community.

Implementation

Market adoption strategy
We want to establish security and sustainability for this cryptocurrency project. In order for a cryptocurrency to be used as a daily use currency, there must be a reliable ecosystem to support both supply and demand.
Determine market share adoption process
Identify need for crypto POS systems among local merchants
Food
Medicine
Houses and renting
Critical adoption locations
Market 
Pharmacies
Landlords 
We plan to establish Decentralized Finance or “DeFi” accounts and other forms of passive income like hosting MasterNodes as a method of cash flow generation and volatility mitigation for the client (merchants). This will help grow the network and users of cryptocurrency in Colombia and eventually throughout Latin America. 

Crypto Education Hub: a Partnership with South American Initiative (SAI) & Cripto Censerje Institute

SAI & Cripto Conserje are building a facility in Colombia to educate and train Venezuelan refugees crossing the border. 
Education is critical so that refugees can learn skills, gain employment and integrate into the local economy. . 

Total facility size will be between 2,500 sq. ft. to 3,500 sq. ft. This facility will allocate 50% of the space for Cripto Conserje that will allow for Cryptocurrency education and additional vocational training to help Latin Americans achieve their goals of independent living in Colombia.

Timeline
6-months to 1-year for construction depending construction permits, resource allocation, and site selection.
1. Land purchase time is approximately 1-4 months. [COMPLETE]
2. Permits 1-3 months for government approval. [COMPLETE]
3. Blueprint design and resource allocation [COMPLETE]
4. SAI will provide staffing for its portion to build and operate the facility








We are experimenting using it as notary and proof of existence of the deed and registration of the land we purchased the signatures and hashes of the deed and certificate has been verified on the Bitcoin blockchain :

We used https://opentimestamps.org/:


 
What Can and Can’t Timestamps Prove?
A timestamp proves that a message existed prior to some point in time; timestamps are occasionally referred to as “proofs-of-existence”. Being able to prove that data existed prior to a point in time is surprisingly useful.
A timestamp proves that some data existed prior to some point in time. OpenTimestamps defines a set of operations for creating provable timestamps and later independently verifying them. At the time of writing timestamping on the Bitcoin blockchain is supported, the format is flexible enough to support a variety of methods. 

Anyone could realize a timestamp with the permissionless blockchain by paying the transaction fees, for your convenience we offer calendar servers that perform this operation for you. These servers are free to use and they don't require any registration or api key.

And get the signatures or hashes to be uploaded to the bitcoin blockchain via their free calendar service.

A timestamp proof in OpenTimestamps is just a list of commitment operations that are applied to the message in sequence. To verify the proof, all that needs to be done is to replay the operations, and check that the final result is a message that you already know existed at a certain time. Since every commitment operation is guaranteed to have a different result for a different input, there’s no way to change the message we’re timestamping without changing the result and invalidating the timestamp.

Conclusion & Desired Outcomes
Cripto Conserje’s project is aligned with the mission of the broader crypto-community: contributing to humanity through innovation. Our partners will gain brand awareness and user adoption in the emerging crypto-market of LATAM. Ultimately, Cripto Conserje hopes this project will alleviate the humanitarian and economic crisis faced by the people of Cúcuta by giving them an alternative payment system. Finally, we hope this project turns into a blueprint for entering different cities in LATAM.

359,trojan-dao-inifinite-moloch,"This research and development project describes a method to create a decentralized and transparently backed credit system as a community-specific digital currency with is governed through a Moloch-fork DAO. Users can mint, burn, and hold the currency and participate in its governance by voting on decisions concerning the allocation / distribution of funds generated via ""DAO Tax"". 

The proposed implementation would operate on a public blockchain and would be backed by Ether. The community currency is 100% backed by reserves, in this case ETH, which are locked into a verified on-chain collateral - The reserve is leveraged into a credit supply, which automatically mints new tokens via a bonding curve smart-contract, a concept originally developed by Eyal Hertzog which he calls the Bancor Protocol. These tokens are essentially a share of the common's economy using them.

We included a ""DAO Tax"" implementation to the token contract. Whenever the token is minted from the token's smart contract or transferred between addresses, an amount of tokens is allocated automatically to a communal pool which governed by the DAO (TrojanPool.sol). the token contract also implements a ""redistribution tax"", a similar mechanism that awards all token holders.

Motivation

Collaborative networks of artist-run, creative communities, and non-commercial initiatives that operate outside institutional frameworks provide an important ground for experimentation, innovation and artistic expression. This is certainly the case for Athens, where the recent past of capital controls and economic uncertainties has led to the closing-down of commercial gallery spaces and the emergence of collaborative networks of support between artist-organised intiatives. However, such initiatives struggle to achieve sustainable methods to support their practices despite having active and dedicated communities who care. The underfunding and privatization of art as a public goods has led to an unsustainable community funding model. 

Furthermore, the mechanism we describe can be considered a ""DAO primitive"" that can forked and the depolyment parameters such as % ""DAO Tax"" and Bonding Curve parameters adapted to scenarios such as creating a BC fundraising mechanism for Moloch-fork DAOs, or Moloch x Continuous Organizations, and other novel crypto-economic experiments and use-cases.


Goals

* Provide creative communities with a usable digital currency built on blockchain technology, as a means of fuelling shared goals and exchanging resources across borders without the mediation of banks and third parties.

* Participants are incetivised to be involved / contribute through the DAO structure.

* Provide a source of revenue for the DAO through the economic activities that its currency generates, via ""DAO tax"".

* Used in community events and activities, and interactions between communities.

* Anti-Speculative: In our implementation, the currency value is pegged to ETH, is backed by a verifiable reserve of ETH that guarantees a minimum value. Future implementations can chose to deploy with different bonding curve parameters, such as in the case for BC fundraising scenarios.

* Making the flow of capital more efficient through the system unlocks collaborative value and benefits all participants. Creating a circular economy between participants, and between participants and the ""outside world"". 

* Autonomous and immutable: There is no ""killswitch"" or ""backdoor"". The only way to withdraw Ether from the smart contract is to burn the token. The creator, nor anybody else, can ever access this reserve pool of ether unless burning tokens, thus guaranteeing a minimum value for each token.

Long Term vision:

In the conditions of today's market-driven global art economy, only the most successful artists afford to sustain their practices. Redistributive and participatory community currencies could help reward and sustain these valuable resources. Artists involved should be able to exchange value between communities and sustain collaborative practices outside the restraints of national borders and capital controls, and without the interference of banks, due to the significant efficiency unlocked in building and operating crypto-economical systems that encode shared values and the pursuit of common goals.

This project demonstrates that the bonding curve token deployed together with a modified version of MolochPool.sol system can be used to automatically grant a Moloch DAO with additional funding through the minting and burning of the token.

TODOs
The TrojanDao.sol contract depends on the TrojanToken.sol contract, which depends on the TrojanPool.sol contract, which depends on the TrojanDao.sol contract. To work around this circular dependency, we had to add a setTrojanPool function. This is horrible for security purposes.
The TrojanToken.sol contract needed to bootstrap the creator with tokens, in order to make testing easier. This should also be fixed for production.
The TrojanToken contract can deposit funds into the Pool, but it cannot exit them. One way to exit the shares is by making a proxy contract that can receive a grant from the Trojan DAO and then call a function in the TrojanToken contract that will exit the funds.
The UI of the DAO (Moloch fork) needs to integrate the TrojanToken methods.
Explore the possibility of altering the “redistribution tax” code so that this amount is spread evenly between holders rather than relative to holdings (more like a ""UBI"").
Run more robust tests with cadCAD, using the results to fine-tune the “tax policies” of the token.



About us:

Trojan DAO is Moloch DAO fork, the result of thinking about what kind of infrastructure is lacking to support independent art produced in the Athenean context, that would allow us coordinate resources and to operate beyond borders. In its early stages the Trojan DAO is stewarded by a group of Athenean Artists and members from the Ethereum community, as it gradually forms a decentralised network between art spaces, communities and projects.

Get in touch with us on Telegram, Twitter, or Github & join our public forum.
 
We are driven by the vision that in the future, art organizations will themselves resemble more closely distributed participatory artworks with multiple contributors, rather than the slow to adapt and inefficient centralised bureaucracies of today.

""Perhaps the Trojan Horse was the first activist work of art [...] the art of activism operates both within and beyond the fortress of 'high art'.

In terms of funding NFT Standards Coordination and organisation of our upcoming event in Paris alongside EthCC. Funds raised through this grant will be used to pay people to coordinate and navigate community to better educational resources, educate community, encourage people to work and build in open source, support Ethereum Core development.

The Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians is a community of Ethereum contributors; we help move the protocol and related tech forward, develop smart contract standards for NFTs, DeFi, and L2s, and, in general improve, communications among teams in the wider community. A key part of the workflow is for Ethereum core devs, dapp devs, researchers, and other stakeholders to get feedback on proposals (known as EIPs). This happens in conference calls, in-person, in chat channels, or on the Magicians' Forum.

We have been organising events, virtual events, hosting discussions, facilitating people and contributing to the Ethereum Ecosystem. For the upcoming activities we are working on  improving DeFi and token-related standards and NFT Standards Working group herding and facilitation in person and online.

We are planning another event in Paris! We will announce details in upcoming days after finalising the last coordination details. 
As an Ethereum Magicians Ops Team, we are working on a bunch of initiatives on how Ethereum Magicians can support the Ethereum Community growth.
 
The ongoing benefit that we bring to the community is that our work empowers decision-makers to gather feedback and move the tech forward, and encourages developers and researchers to collaborate closely via the Magicians' Forum. This helps make Ethereum the best technology that it can be!

Funds received will be managed by members of the Operations Ring, a group which manages resources for the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians, organizes events, and maintains the Forum. Your donation will be used to organize upcoming events and discussions, operate and pay for maintaining and moderating the FEM forum and expenses related to these activities.

2344,interfiprotocol,"Introduction
InterFi Protocol is a cross-chain DeFi interoperability protocol maximizing returns and capital efficiency by enabling liquidity sharing, altcoin leverage and credit lending.InterFi is committed to enabling resource sharing among DeFi applications, and building a series of infrastructure to speed up the development of DeFi.

Advantages
①Build fund flow between applications.It supports structured inerest rate model and flexible term setting, which can statisfy different projects with different risk perferences and different demands. So that the idle funds can be used to eran additional income.
②Flexible and diversified project financing.It supports structured inerest rate model and flexible term setting, which can statisfy different projects with different risk perferences and different demands. So that the idle funds can be used to eran additional income.
③Easier access to funds for projects.The system supports collateralized appropriations and uncollateralized appropriations. No matter whether the project has collateral, can apply to the system to obtain the circulation of financial support.


InterFi is building a new way to use funds with the lower cost of handling capital, less unnecessary voucher tokens, and separation of the use right and property right of funds, to create a more efficient capital market.


Credit is the cornerstone of the business and social activities, of which the form has been evolving since ancient times. Due to the lack of an effective on-chain credit system, many businesses of traditional finance are difficult to be carried out on the chain, or can only be done through over-collateralization.

InterFi is building a new stablecoin FAI with a self-regulating and low mint rate or even negative mint rate. It also provides a set of standard stablecoin DAPI interfaces for other applications. Users can directly freeze or lock assets in other applications to mint stablecoin FAI,which makes it easy to combine other features in the application.


Due to the popularity of over-collateralization and liquidity mining，the fund utilization in the DeFi market has been very low. For instance, CDPs holders in MakerDAO, actually suffer much higher collateralization ratios than the minimum one required by the system, to avoid liquidation.

Designed to streamline and provide a framework-agnostic way of managing the second and most important half of the smart contract deployment process from the perspective of end users, solt comes as an executable file that does not require a complex or opinionated modification to your existing workflow.

Shipping with batteries included is a command line interface for macos and linux depending only on libcurl that can read existing smart contract development file and dependency structures for self-contained projects, as well as projects depending on npm libraries.

The usage is split into two parts:

""write"" - to collect a smart contract and its dependencies into a standard json compatible input for solc, with simple flags for modifying common deployment options in the output like optimisation parameters.

""verify"" - to upload and verify a specific smart contract's standard json of a specified deployed contract, usually created from the ""write"" step, with flags for common options like compiler version and the deployed network to verify code deployed on the test networks supported by Etherscan.

The state of solt at the moment is a working MVP with a few commonly requested features built in to make developers' lives easier, but with additional support I'll be able to dedicate more time to the project and be able to implement functionality that would bring other frameworks and requested features to the tool, as well as helping developers debug their deployment and verification processes while using solt.

241,zero-collateral,"Zero Collateral - Undercollateralized DeFi Loans

Zero Collateral Protocol is an unsecured/undercollateralized lending market on the Ethereum blockchain.

Borrowers must only maintain collateral equivalent to the value of the loan minus the amount of total interest paid from all previous loans. With frequent loan repayments, the required collateral needed for borrowing eventually drops to zero.

The Big Picture

Total global accumulated debt accounts for $215 Trillion in assets, with $70 Trillion added just in the last decade alone, and unsecured debt accounting for over 80% of the total debt.

The need for unsecured and undercollateralized loans is widespread. In America alone, more than 80% of the population owes debt, 58% have less than $1,000 in their bank account, and millions are $400 away from the need to borrow unsecured debt.

The emergence and development of decentralized technology has potential to remove centralized financial custodians. DeFi (“Decentralized Finance”) protocols, such as Compound Finance and MakerDAO, enable borrowers to redeem a loan without borders, censorship, or discrimination.

As most DeFi loans to-date are secured, platforms require over-collateralization — obligating the borrower to already hold assets greater in value than the value of the loan. This constraint results in a ceiling on the market adoption of DeFi, thus cutting out 80%+ of businesses and individuals who borrow unsecured debt.

Current use cases of decentralized loans are limited to leveraged trading and prevention of crypto asset liquidation. In order for the industry of decentralized lending to proliferate and grow, borrowers need access to a decentralized market of unsecured and undercollateralized debt.

Pareto Network is a platform providing current, reputable & actionable Intel for traders and investors. A peer to peer financial content marketplace and an alpha capture System. A two-sided market enabling content contributors to be rewarded for their expertise in proportion to the value it delivers to members. No email or phone needed, your ETH address is your username and how writers get paid.
How does the Pareto Network work?
1.      Submit actionable financial intel :
Intel providers (individuals, groups or organizations) create a broad range of information that may help network participants in making investment decisions in the capital markets.
The content can take many forms from analyst reports & trading signals all the way to code vulnerability & security assessments.
Contributors submit intel to the Pareto Network because the possible earnings from the Network can be greater than attempting to trade on their own and carries less risk.
2.      Pareto Network distributes the intel to investors :
The information is curated & structured by the network, and then distributed to traders based on their PARETO Score™
An algorithm is used to determine the order in which Pareto token holders are presented with the information. The result of this algorithm is called the Information Waterfall.
By having a higher PARETO Score™ a trader can act on valuable information before people with lower scores, giving them a significant advantage.
3.      Intel providers are rewarded based on the quality of their information :
Upon receiving the intel, traders reward the information based on its quality. As a result, intel providers earn and generate revenue.
Intel providers are therefore incentivized to provide quality information to the network, as they can profit more than if they acted on it alone.
Traders make decisions from early and accurate information and they reward the contributor of the intel, as this allows the trader to receive new intel earlier.
The platform aims to ensure that everyone gets paid.

Pareto provides a current, reputable & actionable intel for traders and investors. Join the Pareto Network today and become a member to access Market-Proven trading intel.

👀 TLDR
Peeka VR, a kids education platform, seeks to create an educational VR experience about Ethereum and crypto from ETH Denver's John Paller's book ""B Is For Bufficorns"", to help onboard new generations to the good side. 

🚀 WHAT WE DO
At Peeka, we bring pictures books to life in virtual reality so kids can jump into the pages of beloved books and let the stories happen to them. Our mission is to create delightful, practical experiences that promote learning/reading engagement, comprehension and retention.

We have built the first ever VR book library and platform, and have articulated a pipeline from which similar VR books can be made. Our mobile platform hosts our VR experiences and will eventually host more than only Peeka's experiences. Today, Peeka is live classrooms in SC, ID and exhibiting in WA and more.

📚 AN EDUCATIONAL CRYPTO VR EXPERIENCE FOR KIDS AND ADULTS
As founders who are as interested in Ethereum as they are in virtual reality, we've wanted to use VR to help kids understand the technology of Ethereum while they're still growing and learning. 

This is an opportunity to create a unique, educational, and delightful piece of content that can help onboard new generations to Ethereum and crypto at large. 

We want to use the proceeds of the grant to put towards a new, immersive experience that will teach kids and adults alike about crypto: how it works, why it's important, and how to get started. This experience will be based on an existing story, the ever-popular ""B is for Bufficorn"" by ETH Denver's John Paller. 

See Vitalik, John, and Jared Polis (Gov of CO) reading B is for Bufficorn at ETH Denver. 

🤝 DESIGNING THE EXPERIENCE TOGETHER
In addition to helping us decide which story or form our experience should take on, you'll also be part of a group that helps shape what our experience will be like, including advisement from Ethereum community members like David Hoffman (@trustlessstate) and others.

Here's some quick facts for you to consider about our production:
 Our pipeline for making content here in Seattle allows us to turn an experience around (based on an existing book) in 12 weeks or less. 
 We build all our experiences in Unity, and while we're mobile-based now, we can port to Oculus or HTC Vive whenever. 
 We can make the experience do whatever we want together, and communicate the most important points.
 We have a pipeline of schools, exhibits, and customers who will want to get ahold of this experience as soon as it ships.

Thank you visitors, followers, contributors, partners, builders & the wider community. We want to thank Gitcoin and everyone for their kind contribution. Without your help and generosity, we would not be where we are today so we are very thankful for your continued support. 

Last quarter was one of the most exciting times at the Core Nethermind team and it was only possible thanks to the great Ethereum community that led us through the hard times of the previous years.

In the last 3 months we have focused on growing the core development team and contributing back to the community by organizing an internship program. We designed it to be focused on the individual needs of each participant. We organized it to teach and inspire the future generation of Ethereum technical leaders/developers. The results so far have been absolutely beyond our expectations and we are willing to continue the internship program into the future.

What our interns have achieved in the last months:
won EthGlobal hackathon (as part of a broader team)
co-authored a research paper on MEV after EIP-1559
spoke at the Ethereum Magicians conference in Paris
delivered an implementation of the MEV carrier transactions provider in ethers.js
worked on the implementation of account abstractions
co-authored the implementation of the xDAI-MEV support code
prepared a series of Twitter Spaces during the EthCC conference
introduced multiple minor improvements in the Nethermind client
worked on DeFi projects, writing solidity code
prepared a Solidity security auditing pipeline with Slither, Echidna, Manticore

Further notable achievements over the last few months:
Dark Forest was supported by nearly 30 Nethermind JSON RPC nodes handling player requests on xDAI network
grown Nethermind to 60 people, including interns who joined us for this summer
following recent changes to the tx pool, the amount of transactions that are not visible in the mempool upfront is now less than 5% (some transactions are private) and thanks to improvements to the methods of transaction selections when producing blocks, Nethermind validators waste no blockspace. As well as increased timeouts, should help on bad connections and when connecting to a large number of nodes
added support for eth/66 protocol, eth_feeHistory, eth_gasPrice and trace_filter
fixed problems with memory and eth_callBundle 
improved logging when incorrect configuration config has been found and exported WitnessCollector via RPC module
worked on plugin optimisations and Mainnet chainspec upgrade
implemented and delivered the London upgrade in Nethermind client
implemented The Merge protocol for the Steklo DevNet and participated in the first successful DevNet between seven Eth1 and Eth2 clients
researched and prototyped together with flashbots various MEV approaches in relation to The Merge
worked on a new pruning method (moulting) that copies only the minimal state while the node is running and then drops the previous database
Nethermind client is now supporting flashbots MEV bundles on xDai with more chains to follow
Significant progress has been made in prototyping two different approaches to Ethereum 2 MEV
POA Sokol testnet is now supported by Nethermind nodes only
continue to develop Voyager for StarkNet. Recently started on L1 - L2 messages and introduced writing to contracts through the Voyager webapp
continue to build a strong CI pipeline that checks tests, coverage and run automatic audit tools which includes but is not limited to OpenZeppelin and DeFi-Safety guidelines
put in many hours to improve infrastructure monitoring. Improved alerting system, set up health checks, PPA (Personal Package Archives) for Ubuntu and Homebrew for Nethermind
completed the setup of three Nethermind mainnet archive nodes and provided documentation of our existing infrastructure
setup Ansible scripts for smoother nodes deployment
began working on Warp, an EVM to Cairo transpiler. We recently released a demo of transpiling an ERC20 Solidity contract to Cairo and deploying it to StarkNet. The team implemented the stack, the memory and the arithmetic operations and are finalizing storage opcodes

But we don’t even think of stopping there, here’s our plan but not limited to for the upcoming next few months: 

the merge is on it’s way and that will be our main focus over the coming months. We’ll put  all of our knowledge and efforts to make sure no issues occur and all bugs are fixed 
MEV is a very important part of our mission and the user experience, we will continue to work on it after the merge and look at integrating other sidechains  
continue to improve the stability of the Nethermind client, enhance and improve monitoring and security of the infrastructure, review and improve JSON-RPC, work on account abstraction and continue to support various sidechains 
continue to improve deployment and node management tools and scripts
look for new ways to sync and store Ethereum state and start the research on Verkle trees
release the Flashbots carrier transactions implementation 
build a 1-Click Nethermind Node Setup on the most popular Cloud Providers ( Digital Ocean, AWS, etc. ) and a multi source block/event feed and processing pipeline tool for Ethereum developers 
further development of Warp
last but not least, we want to start a new exciting project of creating a modular execution client that will be compatible with Erigon components

Alliances exist to advance their members’ collective interests by combining their capabilities—which can be industrial and financial as well as military—to achieve military and political success.
 
In previous rounds, some alliances formed by DAO already existed. In fact, alliances can be either formal, written treaties or informal, unwritten agreements based on anything from tacit understandings to verbal assurances. These, may be good enough. However, due to the difficulty of identity verification (not everyone verifies their Twitter) and loose strategic planning, it is hard to implement joint operations in practice. 
 
Because of this, we built up a chain layer alliance system for dark forest players. Start your journey at DarkAlliance to select guilds of choice, discover tasks, utilize gaming tools like group chat or bulletin board, and boost funny based on their performance and engagement in the games.
 
Who are we?
We are a group of Web3 developers from Guild W and RhizomeDAO Labs. The members have backgrounds in Computer Science, Mathematics and Electronic Engineering, with many developers who have worked in the blockchain industry for many years.
 
Guild W is the first on-chain e-sports team, incubated by MarrowDAO. The main members are Solidity developers, node operators, blockchain game players and investment analysts. All of them are loyal players of the Dark Forest. 
 
So far, we have launched DarkSea, the most traded marketplace in the Dark Forest game; DF Explorer, a GPU exploring tool; and Dark Gang (beta), a group competition system for Dark Forest players.

We hope our guild may possess different perspectives at the same time, as visionary as waterdrops. We will uphold the aim of peaceful development and help real blockchain games to grow and prosper.

2090,cercle-dao-paving-the-web3-way-for-the-next-cohor,"Dear Gitcoin Family,

Cercle ⭕️ DAO is the result of an advanced reflexion on the objectives and purpose of a project formerly known as ""bloom.fi"" or ""monportefeuille.digital"". These initiatives have been paused in 2021 while I've been been busy working on a new product for Index Coop. Developing the Cercle community and advocating for a rational, long term approach to crypto investing are the biggest motivations behind this comeback.

➡️ What are the challenges we want to address ?

Our inner purpose and the core values that truly define Cercle go beyond the ""simple"" idea of a research or venture DAO. This mostly comes down to the personal background and experience of our first cohort of core contributors.

Web3 and crypto open a world of financial opportunities, but driving the change and acquiring legitimacy among established VC funds is going to require aspiring research analysts or partners to develop their track record, network and knowledge. 

However, high quality business education and first hands-on experience in the Venture Capital industry still appear to be highly inaccessible for the majority of us - and remain controlled by centralized entities, be it private schools, institutions and / or businesses. 

➡️ What do we want to do about it ? 

Web 3 gives us the tools, narrative and collective power to build and claim ownership of our own ""decentralized MBA"" : designed by the community, project based, with direct real world applications such as research-as-a-service or an on-chain investment club.

Imagine an educational program centered on business / early stage investing, whose ownership is redistributed between students, teachers and partners via a governance token and ""proof of learn"" NFT's : that's exactly what we're building at Cercle ⭕️ DAO !

Ultimately it would be an unbelievable achievement to leverage the power of DAO's and extend bridges with the VC industry, so that contributors :
-- Can find new job opportunities within this sector.
-- Develop the network, knowledge and track record to set up a compliant, legitimate fund all together.

➡️ Who am I ?

My name is Julien, I come from an engineering background but I've been falling down the crypto rabbit hole since 2018. A journey with all its ups and downs, experience which I now use to build Cercle and contribute to Index Coop on the product side, more precisely by doing market research and competitor analysis.

➡️ How do we plan to use any contribution ?

Our first motivation is to raise awareness about our project and develop as many positive-sum partnerships as possible in the ecosystem. Since $CIRCL doesn't have any market value for the time being, any contribution would enable us to accelerate this development, for example by launching enterprise subscriptions for our research tools or advertising the DAO to our potential customers.

Our address to receive and manage funds is public. A big thank you to any potential contributor, the members of our community, and we can't wait to build all these exciting things together !

4281,open-drugs,"
Open Drugs - the database of drug therapies in the field of life extension. 

Thousands of papers report results of intervention testing programs [1,2] - changes in the longevity of a different species using various interventions in biological processes, including medication.
About 1500 mostly mild but statistically significant lifespan increasing drug assays have been cataloged to date using over 560 drugs in 30 species[3] mostly in worm and fly. This suggests an opportunity to contrast and compare the effects and mechanisms of many pharmacological perturbations to drastically accelerate and focus the search for anti-aging interventions as it has already been done in the existing DrugAge[3] project. 
However, a closer look reveals that the data collected there is inconsistent and full of errors. Searching DrugAge for caffeine produces 31 records, where results for worms at a dose of 7.5 mM are reported to both decreased lifespan by 11.6% in one study and increase by 19.6% in another (both marked ""significant""). There are 20 entries for rapamycin in mice, showing both 8% and 36.7% median lifespan increase in the same strain at the same 128 ppm dose. 

What conclusions can we draw from this? Which paper do we trust more? What additional conditions might have influenced the results of these experiments?

In order to get closer to the answers to these questions, we decided to revise the existing literature and create a new, expanded version of the database of aging-related compounds.
Our approach is to take every detail of the experiment into account. What was the strain or breed of the organisms, at what temperature they were kept, what was the start point of the therapy, how exactly the active substance was delivered... Each study has dozens of nuances, and any of them could have an impact on the result. We are convinced that all of them need to be taken into account in order to provide a solid foundation for research in the lifespan-extending field.

To implement this approach, we are starting the development of our new aging-related drugs database - Open Drugs.


Figure 1. Open Drugs prototype.

The list of the details of interventions may vary depending on species and the experiment design, but in common we decided to keep such aspects as:

Sample size of the control and the treatment groups: how many animals were used in the particular experiment
All available survival data on control and treatment groups
Active substance delivery method: injection/food/drink/environment
Substance delivery regime: one-time/repeated/continuous/...
The actual dosage of substance
Delivery vehicle: water, ethanol, DMSO...
Diet conditions: what is the feed, are there any nuances in its preparation
Light cycle: light intensity, light/darkness hours
Temperature conditions
Starting point of treatment in %% of lifespan: larvae/embryo, juvenile, mature
Duration of treatment in %% lifespan 
Density of animals: count per tank/cage/plate

Each of these parameters may be important for understanding the differences in research results. An actual drug amount delivered per time would be much more descriptive than common ""concentration"" designation that often is hard to interpret because drug may be delivered with food once a day, or twice, or dissolved in water being continuously consumed, or just in the environment (like for fish or daphnia) - so actual dosage is very different since drugs are metabolized and excreted differently depending on a mode of administration. Temperature and light exposure could affect both the animals themselves and the drug: species lifespan may be temperature-dependent, active substances may be unstable in the room temperature or under intense light. Variance of density could cause changing of actually consumed feed and drugs, and social interaction might affect lifespan. 

Another crucial part of the longevity-related studies database is the control groups. Focusing on the controls we can raise many interesting questions like: normal lifespan of mouse strain B6 on ad-libitum diet, across all the studies ever published; Is a certain paper reporting life extension reliant on sound controls and thus trustworthy; What are the robust strains of certain species which give similar lifespan distribution for controls across many studies; How do ""standard"" conditions (temperature or diet) compare to one another for a given strain/species. 

Such kind of information may be very useful for designing the further research, and we are already proven that we’ll find there some interesting aspects: Fig. 2 presents lifespans of control mice from the ITP[1] project showing discordance in males but not females of U.Texas from U.Michigan and JacksonLabs. The difference of about 15% in the median couldn’t be explained right now, but we believe that a closer look at the life of controls under different conditions will help us understand this.


Figure 2. Discordance in the lifespans of the control male mice with the same strains in different labs from ITP project

To implement such a project, it is necessary to organize the collection and verification of data. We are developing a system for entering data from publications, which will allow curators to fill and moderate the information from the literature. The concept of the system is shown in Fig. 3, it is currently under development. 


Figure 3. Prototype of the CMS for our database.

The final functionality that we strive for is to make this system open to the community and, especially, to the authors of publications themselves, which will allow the project to become self-sustaining and constantly updated by those who are interested in high-quality structured data.
The database will be searchable at any point, allowing convenient data dumps for further analysis. Another important point is that the project will be open source, we will publish the source code on the GitHub platform. 

What can we all get from this project?
By carefully structuring all research data, we will be able to:
- identify the most and least important conditions in experiments and in the selection of model organisms, thus helping to improve research design
- discover white spots in research, creating a groundwork for upcoming experiments
- create the most high-quality dataset on substances, which can later be used for analysis, for example, select the most tested substances and use this list in ML-based research for similar compounds.

The project is being developed from the idea and under the supervision of Leon Peshkin by Olga Spiridonova

675,legrandjeu-vr-bring-token-economics-gaming-to-the,"LeGrandJeu VR 2.0 - Token Systems Gaming in Cyberspace

tl;dr 2.0:
We want to bring a game that teaches complexity and long-term thinking to come online and help us spread the word about DLT, Token Engineering and Complex System Design. That hasn't changed. What has changed is the understanding gained that so far, VR platforms that offer sufficient inclusivity in terms of cross-device compatibility make development effort  unsustainably high and that the limitations imposed by VR as a medium detract from the dynamic and human experience of LGJ. This why a pivot to a browser-based experience integrated within the TE education efforts is the next logical step. --> LGJVR joins the world in hunting for web devs who want to buidl games that can potentially connect to a smart-contract platform in the backend
--> Starve the hype, feed the soul. Support all Token Engineering grants, starting with: https://gitcoin.co/grants/517/tokenengineering-community

Why LeGrandJeu?
LeGrandJeu (LGJ) has started as a tabletop game in 2016 to let players experience complex scenarios in economic settings that are too complex to just model - because there are few written rules, and many more unwritten ones. Sound familiar? That's LIFE. 

In life, we don't know if buying Tesla stock at 700 USD or BTC at 18k are good decisions. But what makes a good decision? The number of $ in our account? The number of friends we have? The amount of $REP in our Ethereum address?
What if the rules change? What if cash loses meaning and accumulated solar energy in the form of plants becomes new currency?

We do NOT ever know what will happen. This is what LGJ teaches. Collaborate, compete, observe, make moonshine, disrupt. The reveal will come at the end of line. Until then - you must play and make the rules, with consensus or market power. The choice is yours.

How does this relate to Token Systems?
Getting Systems right is hard. The Token engineering community has formed around this corollary and created a movement that is only accelerating in its reach. What we were missing for the longest time was an aesthetic argument as to why getting token economics right is vitally important if we want to create stable futures that support us all and end in an omni-win. LeGrandJeu is a gift that provides that: an experience, directed by a game master, with event cards at his/hers/* discretion, and an open world that the players need to populate. Like the world before BTC, the game is a greenfield and the blocks start to fall in place with the first action. Negotiations between players, fully open outcomes, unexpected events and unknown win conditions lead to very interesting observations that provide insights that help us reason about the systems we build and pay attention to new details. 

What we need to do 2.0
Corona and growing sense of CO2 footprint drive a wedge between us in this space. Meetups, Conferences, Group Calls take place in Cyberspace, in VR and in 2D. Board games? Not so much.We want to bring LGJ into VR and connect fans who met and played at many Blockchain events over the years. But more importantly, we want to bring Token and Complex Systems Education onto a medium of the future.

What has happened so far?
LeGrandJeu has found incredible traction in the Token Engineering community, our Social links and website are the testament to that. We I, @crypt0dawg and others from the community have written extensively about the subject of Complex Systems Design. We want to take this to include a medium and mode that reaches more people much more directly than through the analytical left brain aspect.


Grant 2.0
What was accomplished with 1.0 of this grant?
Demo environments for a previously experienced play-case were tested in RecRoom, altspaceVR and mozillahubs
Dev Effort to achieve minimal functionality was ranked, RecRoom came out on top
user interviews have clearly shown that a VR experience is limiting (experienced LGJ before) and  overwhelming (newcomers) 
Additionally, there is a greater need for representations of game state with a high informatino density but low cognitive workload which is currently best achieved by browser-based games

What is going to be accomplished with this grant?
Cross-insemination in our LeGrandJeu network
VR: a long-term RnD vision for LGJVR - the world's medium of choice is the video call.
Training of new game masters (through playing!)
Buidling an web application that integrates well into the didactic approach of the wider TE community 
Formalizing token economic patterns and primitives into specific game scenarios so the bridge to cross from game to token engineering becomes shorter for everyone 
Attracting developer and design talent to give shape to this vision because good web game design is not trivial.

Apparel pricing is often set by perceived value, driven primarily by emotion/hype and information asymmetry around material/production costs and product quality. This has contributed to weak retail sales, struggling brands and dissatisfied customers. Additionally, consumers are starved for meaningful, authentic relationships with brands.

1154,digiwills,"The world moves more and more towards the digital era, digitalizing almost completely our lives, both socially and financially. 
Nowadays: 
·        Facebook has more than 2 billion active users. 
·        More than 1.5 billion people have a Google account 
·        Twitter has more than 300 million active users monthly. 
But people are not just limited to having email accounts and social networks, also, investment accounts, access to banks, bank accounts, cryptocurrency keys, virtual wallets, access to virtual exchanges and more. With the growing rise of cryptocurrencies, millions of dollars are lost in the blockchain of deceased people or with lost access.

Digiwills is a service based on a smart contract that aims to ensure that your digital assets are not lost or fall into the wrong hands. Thanks to the blockchain technology, with this innovative service it will be possible to safely leave all your digital assets.
 
 Such as: Access to Cryptographic Portfolios, Exchange, bank accounts, emails and passwords of your social networks and everything that only you have access to.
 
 With this service we can leave everything in order for our families to enjoy our digital assets.

Features:
Decentralized: The service will be based on an smart contract in the blockchain, this means that no entity or person will have access or control to the data of the users. Only the users themselves and the successors will have access, once the information is sent to them.
Reliable and safe: The data will be stored in the blockchain, encrypted with the owner’s key. Once in the blockchain there will be no way to alter or read them without the owner’s key. Being a decentralized service, the data will be replicated throughout the network so losing them will be impossible.
Safe: Being a decentralized service, the data will be replicated throughout the network so losing them will be impossible.

How it works
On the platform, the user will be able to create an account where they can save sensitive data, such as: users and passwords, details of bank accounts or any information they wish to be grouped in blocks (Wills), in the blockchain in a secure way, to these blocks the user can assign successors which will receive the information contained in the block (Will).
 
 These blocks (Wills) will be encrypted using the unique key of each user, therefore only the owner will have access to said information and his assigned successors once he meets certain criteria.
 
 The service will consume an amount of the Digiwills Token (DGW) daily, as a condition to keep your data retained. If account run out of funds, the system will send the data to successors.

Development goals:
·        2020 Q1: Smart Contract Development, Web client development 
·        2020 Q2: Development Desktop App client 
·        2020 Q3: Development Mobile App Android client

952,krredit-defi-loans-without-collateral,"Imagine if everybody on the planet could borrow money when they need it most, regardless of their credit scores or banking status. 

Krredit brings the biggest value proposition of Centralised Finance- Unsecured Lending, to DeFi. Today, 7 out of 10 people have no formal way to borrow money, even in an emergency. The unemployment caused by the virus has worsened the demand/supply mismatch in unsecured lending markets. Banks are content to lend to only the highest credit scorers, leaving the bulk of the population excluded from the credit system.

This is a wonderful opportunity for Decentralised Finance to solve a massive, real-world problem that banks have failed to solve. Of course, under-collateralised loans are vulnerable to default; but with Krredit we've worked out a system of incentives that encourage sufficient repayment of loans; along with a mathematical model that always keeps default exposure for lenders very low. 

But won’t everyone default?

Single turn Game Theory would predict that a person given an unsecured loan would always default, in the absence of consequence. However, Multi-turn game theory, as seen in the repeated prisoners dilemma, tells us that tit-for-tat is the most efficient strategy when you have to repeatedly interact with the same agent. This implies that repeated incentives may be sufficient to ensure repayment, without any coercion. 

Our unique mathematical model returns 10-18% ARR to lenders, even with a 30-40% default rate. The interest charged to borrowers will initially be high (~20%), but the alternative to most people is no credit whatsoever, particularly in developing parts of the world. You can find more details in this Medium article . 

Crucially, the Default exposure as % of Principal is always below 1% for all loaned amounts. The mathematical model showing how this works can we viewed in this spreadsheet.

Due to the high potential returns and low default exposure, we're confident lenders will participate. Because it is open to everybody, borrowers will participate. 

Krredit will go live on the ethereum mainnet within a month, with a custom UX for easy participation. Beyond development, we will utilise the grant money for the initial lending pool, which will thereafter grow organically as borrowers and lenders participate.

Join us in replacing banks by providing easy credit to everyone on the planet!

P.S. you can find a great demonstration of multi-turn game theory is here.

You can get 50% Gitcoin grants match bonus by verifying your Gitcoin account with Idena.

Idena is the first proof-of-person blockchain where every node belongs to a unique individual and has equal voting power. For now, it is one of the most decentralized functioning blockchains: The Idena network has more that 14k validated users with 2k mining nodes.



To formalize a unique human, Idena does not require the disclosure of any personal data (no KYC). It proves the humanness and uniqueness of its participants by running an AI-hard Turing test. All participants from around the globe must appear online at the same time to solve the test.

Every validated participant has an Ethereum-friendly address. All validated participants can act as oracles across various blockchains.

Why we see a dedicated blockchain to be the best and probably the only viable solution for Sybil protection:

The Idena blockchain is designed to be scalable enough for a real time validation session (no Cryptokitties can kill Idena)
The Idena blockchain is designed to make the validation session free of charge (there is no need to buy coins for validation)
The Idena blockchain provides free and decentralized storage of the validated identities registry

How you can help

Help us raise funds to improve the Idena protocol and increase its adoption.

Official website

Subscribe our Medium and read regular posts about molecular biology of aging




Latest release includes:
New filters panel
Orthologs in various organisms including flies, mice and more than 30 other animals on a gene page;
Updated data on age-related changes in gene expression in humans;
New section with research data on the effect of a calorie restriction diet on gene expression;
Fix ups for several major issues with front-end performance;
Many enhancements of back-end architecture.

We have already added data from almost 1000 experiments in which the lifespan of mice, flies and worms has been altered by genetic intervention. We have also added more than 2,000 age-related gene activity changes in 30 organisms in more than 200 tissues. We collected data on over 200 allelic variants associated with longevity or the aging phenotype. Now we continue adding data from model organisms lifespan studies. We are also preparing a large new batch of data on age-related changes in human gene expression, associations of gene variants with longevity, and the impact of physical activity and diet on gene expression. In parallel, we are improving the data structure and a set of filters that will allow users to compare genes with each other according to dozens of criteria.
 
In addition, we provide a lot of other data about each gene: what mechanisms of aging the gene is involved in, what diseases it is associated with, when it appeared in the evolution history, where this gene is located in the human genome, what functions the gene product performs, in what tissues it is expressed.


Open Genes  is a biological database of human genes associated with aging and lifespan.


Main page

Open Genes is about open and structured data. We give researchers in aging genetics efficient tools for analyzing our data: gene functions, evolution, the influence of gene activity on lifespan, age-related changes in gene expression, methylation and protein activity, associations of allelic variants of genes with longevity and age-related phenotype, processes, aging mechanisms and diseases the gene products are involved in.



We carefully structure data on the genetics of aging to achieve three goals:
find potentially useful combinations of effects on genes to create a complex therapy for aging;
find white spots in the genetics of aging, which means new ideas for research;
evaluate the quality and reliability of the results of existing experiments;
create a gold standard for structuring biological data.


Data tables with researches conditions and results on a gene page

When developing OpenGenes, we relied on the approaches of these two databases. We also asked questions:
What data is essential for assessing the quality of an experiment?
Considering the quality of the experiments and the significance of the results, what genes can be viewed as the most attractive targets for the therapy of human aging?
Why aren't experimental results always reproducible?
What kind of improvements or deterioration in the health of model organisms were observed with changes in gene activity?


API documentation

The results of the experiments show that by changing the activity of just one gene, we can extend the life of nematodes and flies two or more times, and for mice - one and a half times. The GeneAge database contains more than two thousand genes. Changes in the activity of that genes affect the lifespan of model organisms such as mice, nematodes, flies, and yeast. More than 1,800 mutation combinations and their effects on lifespan are provided in the SynergyAge database.

To answer these questions, we provide accurate, complete and structured data on experimental design, model organism, and results. We provide approximately up to 40 parameters for each individual manipulation, depending on the method and data availability:

control line;
sex;
the number of animals in the control and experimental groups;
temperature;
diet;
the main effect on gene activity (suppression, enhancement or switching of function);
method of exposure (obtaining transgenic animals, exposure with a drug, inducible mutation);
method (RNA interference, knockout, additional copies in the genome, protein therapy, and others);
genotype obtained as a result of genetic manipulation;
tissue specificity;
genetic drivers and promoters used in experiment;
drug (if it was used in the genetic experiment) and conditions for taking the drug (frequency, dosage, route of administration, age of onset and termination of the course);
conditions for taking the drug (frequency, dosage, route of administration, age of onset and termination of the course);
percentage of change in the expression of the target gene with an indication of the tissue where measurement was carried out;
result in relation to life expectancy (increase, decrease, increase in life expectancy in animals with a reduced life span);
minimum, average, median and maximum control lifespan;
minimum, average, median and maximum life expectancy of the experiment;
% change in life expectancy;
statistical significance;
results in relation to age-related processes (processes in which improvements were observed and processes in which deterioration was observed as a result of manipulation).



A piece of the visualized database structure


Combining these parameters allows you to assess the quality of the experiment and better understand its results.

Form for filling data from studies manually by biologists. The updated data will appear on the website in a few months.

In addition to detailed data on the increase and decrease in life expectancy, we provide additional results of the intervention: a list of processes in which improvements and deterioration were observed as a result of genetic manipulation. This approach allows one to see the possible mechanism of the effect of genetic manipulation on life expectancy and opens up great opportunities for the search for potentially successful combinations of targets. This will make Open Genes a powerful tool for finding them.

Benefits

All provided data is up-to-date and proven. Open Genes regularly adds fresh data from aging research papers and the other databases. Our biologists manually check all data. All genes added to the database are being checked by selection criteria.

The data is structured and available for analysis by data scientists and bioinformaticians. Everything that is possible is given in a strict structured form. Try Open Genes API and use data in your own projects. 

We collect genomic data and proteomic and transcriptomic data (age-related changes in protein levels, protein activity, mRNA, associations of protein and mRNA levels with longevity and age-related phenotype).

We constantly develop and improve functionality: search, sorting, filters, data download, data visualization, and much more.


Filtered search feed

We take the best from other aging genetics projects. We update and check their data, link it with our own, and bring it to a single form.

Open Genes is an open-source project. You can copy the code of all our applications and our data and continue development with your approach. You can also improve existing features or add data and suggest these changes. Funding Open Genes, you fund aging research tools.

Also, our product is scalable and uses a modern technology stack. This is something that biologists often do not think about when launching IT projects.

3125,behodler-liquidity-protocol,"What is Behodler?

Behodler is a liquidity protocol centered on a highly gas efficient, single contract AMM.

How will Behodler benefit the ecosystem?

Behodler has successfully demonstrated the benefits of using omnischedule token bonding curves to achieve gas efficient swapping. Currently, complex mainnet Ethereum Defi strategies are hindered by the friction of high gas costs for auto-compounding and pooling operations. Most of the sophisticated strategies have migrated to layer 2 chains. We'd like to position ourselves as the clearing house of yield instruments on mainnet so that dapps can swap in and out of various yield bearing instruments at minimal cost. For instance, migrating LP tokens from Uniswap to Sushiswap, swapping Eth for tokenized Uniswap V3 positions or any other autocompounding strategy. 
In addition, our liquidity token is unique in that it offers a way to link liquidity pools across layers, creating a universal pool of liquidity on Ethereum.

What else does the Behodler ecosystem offer?

The liquidity token on Behodler, Scarcity (SCX) is unique in that it's both a traditional liquidity token and the medium of exchange on the AMM. The price algorithmically reflects the level of total liquidity in the AMM and acts as a weighted basket of liquidity. The liquidity token burns on transfer, creating a gravity well of liquidity into the Behodler ecosystem.

Behodler allows tokens traded to be registered as burnable if they expose a burn function. When burnable tokens such as Maker trade on Behodler, a trading fee is burnt, providing a deflationary service to the holders of the token traded.

Tokens that are not burnable have their fee wrapped in a burnable wrapper known as a PyroToken that is designed to provide burn incentives, increasing the redeem rate and offering an excellent HODL primitive for the underlying token. By transferring trading fees from traders to holders, Behodler redirects miner extracted value (MEV) from trades on your favourite token back into your wallet.


Does Behodler offer staking incentives?

By housing all of its liquidity in a single contract, Behodler makes certain trade-offs. While gas consumption is 50% to 60% lower than prevailing AMMs, new token listings are required to arrive with liquidity equal to the average dollar value of liquidity in the AMM in order to not upset the price equilibrium. As liquidity grows, this proposition becomes increasingly infeasible. A first pass at the challenge would be to crowdfund the entire required liquidity, pool it and release the liquidity token to the crowdfunders in proportion to their contributions. This suffers from a number of UX and incentive drawbacks such as requiring crowdfunders wait for the funding round to end and not rewarding them unless the target threshold is met.

Limbo is the yield farm dapp on Behodler and offers a reward token, Flan (FLN), immediately upon staking liquidity to create a familiar farming dapp experience. When enough liquidity has been raised, the staking mechanism is locked and the total staked liquidity is migrated to Behodler, generating SCX. This SCX is then used to purchase Flan on the open market and pool it on another AMM such as Uniswap. In this way, staking rewards are temporally separate from liquidity generation but the value of Flan is still algorithmically backed by SCX. This bridges the UX experience without creating an inflationary reward token, sealing all incentive loops in a sustainable manner.

In addition to providing a mechanism that helps bootstrap liquidity for new tokens added to Behodler, the Limbo dapp will allow us to offer perpetual staking rewards, beginning with rewards for our governance token, EYE and our liquidity token, SCX, as well as any other instrument that the community believes would benefit the ecosystem.

Where is Behodler now?

The AMM is live on Mainnet with a handful of popular tokens tradeable. We're furiously building both a new UI experience and Limbo in parallel.

What's in the future for Behodler?
Limbo will be the final piece in the puzzle required to scale to layer 2. In addition, we'll be launching dapps that strengthen the ecosystem such as a token burning reward dapp called Bonfire.

Is this project decentralized? How does governance work?

Behodler has a governance token, EYE, with all contracts owned by a DAO. The DAO controls which tokens are listed for swapping. Limbo will be the first 100% community-configured farming dapp with an agile Limbo DAO steering the process. Every decision down to APYs per pool will be controlled by the community, primarily through quadratic voting in conjunction with Snapshot for zero gas governance.

What will you use the Gitcoin grant for?

In order to meet the needs of the ecosystem both within Behodler and for Ethereum as a whole, we would use the grant to:

Expand our development team, making certain roles permanent (on both front end and for smart contract writing).
Actively engage in targeted synergistic cross project collaboration. Since we offer a very potent initial listing mechanism, projects seeking an immediate liquidity boost will be offered spots on Limbo in exchange for exposure of Behodler to their native audience as well as other partnerships. We are currently engaged in talks with a few projects and would like to expand our reach. Our community holds firm to the principle that dapps operating on a permissionless, open blockchain do not compete in a zero sum game for customers but rather all benefit one another by enriching the ecosystem and opening up new niches.
Ongoing code auditing for all dapps in the ecosystem. We are proud of the fact that the Behodler AMM has suffered no exploits and we wish to keep this record intact.

We provide the DAO-VC toolkit: from formation, to voting, to investing. By providing vesting tracking and displaying real-time portfolio activity, Coinocracy enables hybrid investing models on your terms.

What is Coinocracy up to?
We’re focusing on providing the most advanced toolkit for building DAO VCs -- allowing DAOs to financialize and invest in their communities in a productive way while making even the most risk-averse investors comfortable. Behind the treasury curtain, this helps unlock nascent assets held by liquidity pools and protocol treasuries. We also offer early supporters and backers, perhaps new to crypto, a platform to earn returns and generate value for their community through highly-composable governance, regulatory, and legal frameworks. We have been heavily exploring new models for investing and staking into crypto-transitory projects and foresee blurring the line between on-chain and off-chain support of innovation.



How are we different than other DAO investment projects?
We see ourselves a primarily a platform to help crypto investors truly understand (1) their investments (in crypto-native projects & communities), (2) their LPs (i.e. funders - whether they're DAOs, liquidity pools, or more traditional sources of funding), and (3) their financials (because let's face it — venture capital gets confusing, and it hasn't adapted properly to Web3 yet). We want to build the bridge from TradFi to DeFi to help investors become allies, not just piggybanks. This means that we're focused on R&D to build cutting-edge DeFi tooling on top of standard DAO and venture capital formation.

What have we done so far? 
(1) Built out some pretty rad bespoke client partnerships with the most degen of Web3 frens. Stay tuned, or reach out to learn more.
(2) Launched our thought leadership push, including our free token vesting contract tracker that gives you just a taste of the kind of DeFi-to-TradFi tooling we'll integrate into our platform.
(3) Innovated on our legal and smart contract stacks for seamless formation & compliance + create better alignment of incentives for investors.




What do we really need?
(1) To hire you — especially if you know how to (a) build communities (think social, enabling partnerships, client relationships, and advancing thought leadership collabs within our networks) or (b) build smart contracts (Eth & Algo right now).
(2) Pre-seed funding — we're currently raising. Reach out at hello@coinocracy.finance to chat.
(3) To collaborate with you — if you are involved with a VC firm, in angel investing, in DAOs or other communities that want to start investing, etc.

981,aave-token-exchange,"
This grant aim to fund ""AAVEX"" which is an aTokens exchange leveraging on the Bancor Nerwork swap mechanism allowing double AMM yield for liquidity providers. 

Taking advantage of bancor V2 new design that solves the dirty little secret of the AMMs more known as ""impermanent loss"" and Aave lending platform, the implemented dapp will allow LPs to:

Earn Aave interests.
Earn Bancor trading fees
Allow Single-Token Exposure.
Amplified Liquidity.
And all this without impermanent loss.

This project will implement custom AMM based on bancor new design and add them to the already deployed bancor network, all the tokens deposited through the customs pools will be sent to Aave and the minted aTokens will be kept by the pool.

Technical aspects

The users providing liquidity in the custom pools will receive a double yield from Bancor trading fees and Aave interest earnings without suffering from any impermanent loss since the new design based on Chainlink oracle will be used. A liquidity providers allowing X amount of tokens to the custom pool will also provide that same amount to Aave. 

The custom pool will not implement any mechanism to borrow funds since the fund will be moved around when a swap occurs.

A single pool KNC/BNT will allow trading on KNC/aKNC/BNT, this will increase the pool tradings fees since more swap path are enabled.

If a users judge that the token swap mechanism is more expensive since we are making extra steps by depositing to Aave or withdrawing from it, he can always use the aToken pair, for example instead of swapping BNT/KNC the user can choose BNT/aKNC wich will avoid interacting with aave and reduce the transactions fees.

The new Bancor design indirectly eliminated a major issue of the custom pool design, in case if all the liquidity in Aave is borrowed and swapping through the custom pool won't be possible, once the borrowers pay back their loans and fees there will be no arbitrage opportunity since the Chainlink oracle will fill that gap buy just setting the latest prices.

Take a Look

A beta v1 demo is available in https://aavex.decentrify.io, v1 custom pool does not implement the new Bancor features yet.

Funding 

The funding will:

- Help set up a team.
- Create bounties to upgrade the UX/UI.
- Build & deploy the solidity contracts.
- Create and build a decentralized incentivize model based on staking pool tokens for the initial liquidity providers, where a minimum of 40% of the project generated fees will be paid to the LPs.
- Help the project to kickstart and create a marketing campaign.

My primary research interests involve cryptocurrency, as well as security and privacy in cloud computing environments. 

Unfortunately, many people hear about crypto coins connected with criminals who are increasingly using cryptocurrencies for illegitimate activities like money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion. These kinds of news overshadow the wide adoption and growing up of crypto assets in the context of society and decentralization financial. In light of this, I am proposing to bring a legal and educational perspective of crypto coins and blockchain to my students and the academic environment, focusing on the advantages of using cryptocurrencies such as security and speed up transactions free of the bank tax.

At a first glance, I will be focusing on classes and college students using the Portuguese language. As the project progresses, I will expand the scope to the English language as well. This grant will be applied in new research, teacher training, and scientific publications to leverage and make popular concepts of crypto coins.

Cheers!!!

SkyLive shows how effective is Skynet, it's a great example-implementation, but we don't want to stop here.

While video files are stored on Skynet, we need to store playlist files on our centralized server. Our main goal is to create a p2p database where all metafiles accessible to anyone - anyone can start his own SkyLive site and all content will be available on every SkyLive-webportal. Imagine that you can start your own youtube with all it's contents. That's what we want to do with SkyLive!

The NFT world needs to find more sources of value than speculation and demand, as the current hype offers little to no longterm thinking.
We propose to generate a decentralized critics network for NFTs, focusing on gaming and art. 

We want to build a sustainable NFT ecosystem. The NFT ecosystem as it stands is not anti-fragile. We are aware we cannot remove the fragility from the scene but we can alleviate it.
For this purpose, we need to grow credibility within the NFT scene. While the scene is sustained by the web3 crowd and artists onboarding, we're still in a hype cycle. When the hype is down, there will be a new asset class and a new community to capture traction and attention.
It's worth noting that the current attention of the art world into NFTs (e.g. Christie's) is driven mostly by monetary incentives - the art world is still largely sceptical of NFTs and so far it's been very hard for most artists to sell digital pieces.
We would also like to open up for internal critiquing of the area, as this will allow for development from within. The creation of systems without consideration and reflection is not a sustainable way forward, and we believe that by following the current path we're on the course of recreating old systems in new formats.

NFT critics are a new kind of critic class. We intend to create our own class of critics and to aid this task, the OG DAO founders will be proposing a basic framework for critiques.

The funds will go to the already set up Gnosis Safe of the Critique DAO. With time we will be adding more members and functionalities, but we already have a multisig! 

Funders of the project will be able to access the DAO :)

Our biggest dream is to create a truly unique human collaboration experience formed by people with different professional backgrounds that will each dedicate spare time and good will to the common missions chosen. We are basically a bunch of creative people that want to extend their scope and also broaden their network by doing this. We wish to create a community of creatives and hopefully experts that believe in creative experimentation and making society more fun to be part of and help nurture nature in inner city areas. 
Our first mission is to try to use creativity as fuel to transform small parts of Romanian cities at first.

We believe that the real world can be just as fun as the meta-verse and the two should merge in healthy and unexplored ways.

Mafia Creativa is also focused on the education and delivering education. We need to get creatives, altruistic people and builders educated around blockchain, web 3 and technology and teach them how to leverage these new tools to have an amazing impact in society and also in their personal lives.
It's even more than that, this is not only about crypto it's about teaching creatives how to think and how to live sustainable lives by creating stuff that they love.
Basically we are trying to create a system that can reward good people for doing good work and for making the world a more beautiful place!

From our inception in 2021 we have focused on educating creatives and giving them the tools they need to begin their decentralized digital journey: 

-in 2020 we have created a Twitter support group for creatives that wanted to join web 3, understand NFTs, create NFTs, etc.(we chose twitter because it the most popular platform for NFT creatives)
-established a community of creatives with different backgrounds both online and offline
-onboarded and offered free education, resources and tutoring with the creatives we onboarded
-untangled the mistery of NFTs for +30 romanian artists and +50 overall.
-some of our members actively contribute in DAOs like 1Hive, Agave, NFBeez, TEC, Gitcoin and Giveth. We actively help spreading the word about these amazing communities.
-collaborated with the NFBeez from 1Hive
Decision making is also decentralized and we vote on the next idea 

2022 Updates: 
-Onboarded members of Ambra, a fashion brand. 
-Raised awareness about Giveth, Gitcoin, 1Hive in the Jiu Valley region and Timisoara. Created Giveth projects for numerous altruistic initiatives.  
-Reached out to municipalities and animal shelters in order to onboard them into web 3.

1243,the-agricultural-food-production-project-the-syri,"

we came from the earth and we go back to it ! 

After 2 years of independent work and personal efforts on community building and active citizenships in Greece, we are seeking your support to develop our agricultural and food production project 🤞🏽 
 
In 2019, SGYF team started developing connections with the solidarity and farmers network in Thiva City, and the village of Erythres. we co-worked with the Solidarity felids project to develop our agriculture skills and implement a farming project. We were invited to present our team and our work at the Thiva Antiracist Festival 2019 , And we introduced our culture by performing music and dance. 🤝

This was described as unique: the first participation by a refugee group with such a perspective on active citizenship. And from this we were invited to be one of the groups creating and organising the first Solidarity Festival by refugees and migrants in the city . 

We already built connection with employers who are hiring our community members to do part time jobs in agricultural work, to maintain our costs but also to support our learning by doing ! Now, we are looking to build on these connections, aiming to provide food sustainability and employment, and to develop our cultural exchange with the local market by introducing new products. 

Also planing to offer a healing experience to those who visits us by being close to the earth , interacting with the nature and animals, and further more to launch a DAO prototype for our project .


What’s the Plan?

The concept of our own DAO was born out of the HACKUMENTA workshops in Athens, organised by the Trojan DAO and Agency DAO, where we used the DAO Canvas methodology to design a DAO specially for the governance of this project. 

Launching the SGYF DAO pilot we seek to enable the following:

Our community members will be empowered to share in the common benefit of the outputs of the project and participate in group decision making. To enable our community members to democratically govern this project, and award contributions.To collaborate with other teams from other locations whose goals align with ours.

To transparently track how funds are being used in the project and that they're being used within accepted boundaries.
Our long-term goal to help create a sustainable and fair regenerative economy for our community, and to prove a new co-ownership and active citizenship model.

Once the DAO is launched, all funds collected for this grant will be deposited into our DAO to kickstart our Agricultural project in Thiva!


This year we rented a piece of land of 8000sq.m in Erythres, a village 10 minutes away from the city of Thiva, where we are planting and growing biological vegetables and herbs to produce traditional Syrian Moneh. 

Moneh – food products consumed and stored all year long !! including cheeses, yoghurt, pickled vegetables, and sauces – has supported the Syrian economy for hundreds of years. We aim to share this culture with the Greek society as a tool of food sustainability while thousands of families who live in and around Athens are struggling to maintain their daily needs. 💪🏽 🌱 👇🏽 

 
We have spotted multiple apartments for rent at the village and we are planing and working on renting 3 apartments on the site, where three families with agricultural expertise will live and work. and we are working on finding ways to cover the cost of a 6 months period . This is the time needed to turn the land into a fully sustainable site of food production.


Our agricultural project will also provide employment opportunities for others, and we are developing a flexible working system to support the maximum number of people possible. We will also assist people seeking other jobs in and around Thiva, and are developing a plan to serve as a guarantor for people renting apartments in the area from 2021.


Making it Sustainable 🙏🏽 

To complete this cycle, and in collaboration with the Solidarity felids project, we will run a social cafe – Collectiva – in the Exarcheia neighbourhood of Athens. (We are in the process of setting this up as a farming association, which will be the first such institute in Athens.)

There we will sell and market our products, host social and cultural events, and offer further employment opportunities for the active members of the community who are unable to reach jobs in and around Athens  .
The profits that we make from this enterprise will be managed on a community level, and will go back into the farming project: replanting the land, expanding our production and distribution capacities, investing in our business operations in Athens, and generating more jobs in the process.

Our ultimate goal with this project is to set up a full-scale food production operation in the area around Thiva, with jobs and housing for c.250 people.


What do we Need?

We need €5000 to get the project up and running. This includes the costs for the land, for the production space, and transportation costs between the sites. Please find the budget breakdown below. We have calculated that our monthly running costs for the project once we have everything setup will be €700pcm (covering gas for our van, land maintenance costs and general expenses), and we expect to make the project self-sustainable by generating the revenue to cover our own costs gradually . We are very happy to answer any questions and to discuss this further. Many thanks for your support!

POTION ALLOWS YOU TO
📌   Choose any asset for the option contract (ETH, BTC, MKR, Tesla, Gold, etc)
📌   Choose any strike price for the option contract 
📌   Choose any expiration term for the option contract
📌   Exercise at any moment during the holding period of a contract
📌   Have guaranteed exercise via collateral in escrow on-chain

📌   Perfect pricing based on Black Scholes logic and UMA priceless oracle.
📌   Single liquidity pool for all assets, strikes and expiries = better capital efficiency for LPs

KEY DIFFERENCES VS EXISTING DeFi OPTION PLATFORMS
📌 Only platform to allow minting options on assets other than ETH
📌 Only platform to allow minting DeFi options on Fiat assets
📌 Only platform to have Black Scholes neutral pricing
📌 Only platform to have a single pool across asset types, strikes and expirations

Read more at: https://docs.potion.finance/

How it's made

POTION'S BLACK-SCHOLES PRICING SYSTEM

Pricing the premium of an insurance product is tricky. Price it too high, and the buyer is over-paying for the insurance; price it too low, and the seller ends up losing all their collateral very quickly. 

Potion uses an innovative approach to pricing, that finds fairest premium pricing possible for both buyer and seller.

Potion's system removes the need to ""guess"" what volatility will be when pricing an option - instead, it only fully settles the price at liquidation, on the basis of actual observed volatility (also referred to as realized volatility). This is a key innovation, not available in classical fiat system.

POTION's ORACLING

📌Potion uses UMA's priceless contract technology, and has access to its distrubuted human oracling solution (DVM).
📌UMA uses clever game theory to minimize the number of times participants call the Oracle, saving both on-chain fees and time. This is how it works:
📌Users are able to either take automatic pricing, or to submit their own manually if they believe automatic pricing isn't working.
📌Undisputed pricing: When users' submitted pricing matches pricing observed by contract seller, no Oracle will be required.
📌Disputed pricing: If the sponsor disagrees with pricing used by users when buying potion puts, or exercising them, they’re able to dispute the operation and invoke UMA’s DVM oracle. The DVM Oracle will to ask $UMA holders to vote on a neutral price, and the dispute will be settled.

Both parties benefit from this approach:
Users are incentivized to use correct pricing, or else they risk facing penalties, and losing money.

In case of disagreement, a neutral third party distributed human oracle will produce a price and settle the dispute. In most cases, the right price will be used, saving on-chain transaction costs, oracle calls and delays.

TECH

📌Potion put contracts are built using UMA technology. We took UMA's standard synth factory, and modified it to deploy put-contract minters, as opposed to UMA's standard overcollateralized synthetic minters.
📌We customized the UMA contracts substantially to allow disputing not only during liquidation, but also during minting, to accommodate our financial Black-Scholes logic.
📌For the front end, we used: Vue.js, Node.js, Ethers.js
📌We did significant econometric analysis on Black-Scholes and historical volatility, to determine how to size-up the necessary premium_deposit.

4114,clean-air-task-force,"🌍Recommended most impactful climate non-profit by Founders Pledge Climate Research (great analysis of their work)


Clean Air Task Force (CATF) is a non-profit organization working to safeguard against the worst impacts of climate change by catalyzing the rapid global development and deployment of low-carbon energy and other climate-protecting technologies. This is accomplished through research and analysis, public advocacy leadership, and partnership with the private sector. With nearly 25 years of nationally and internationally recognized expertise on clean air policy and regulations and a fierce commitment to fully exploring all potential solutions, CATF is an environmental advocacy group with the bold ideas needed today to solve the climate crisis.


CATF is on a mission to push the change in technologies and policies needed to get to a zero-emissions, high-energy planet at an affordable cost. CAFT envisions a world where rising energy demand is met, locally and globally, in a way that is financially, socially, and environmentally sustainable.

Focus Areas:
Advanced Energy Systems: Provide the world with pathways to a zero-carbon energy system.
Advanced Nuclear Energy: Create a global research, development, commercial, regulatory, and social ecosystem in which nuclear technology can flourish and emerging technologies can be realized.
Bioenergy: Redirect the production and use of conventional bioenergy so that it contributes to, rather than undermines, decarbonization and climate stability. Ensure that bioenergy use is at least carbon neutral and, where possible, carbon negative.
Decarbonized Fossil Energy: Rapidly accelerate the adoption of carbon-capture technologies to prevent the emission of millions of tons of CO2 from power generation and industrial sources around the world.
Power Plants: Enact direct carbon limits on power plants—gas as well as coal—and ensure the adoption of emission standards, by legislation or regulations, on U.S. fossil power plants that would zero out U.S. power sector carbon emissions by 2050.
Super Pollutants: Catalyze deep, global reductions in methane and black carbon emissions to stave off the risk of irreversible changes to our climate.


Excerpt from FoundersPledge Analysis of Clean Air Task Force:

""What do they do?
The Clean Air Task Force’s work is currently roughly evenly divided between (1) clean air advocacy and (2) promotion of innovation in neglected low-carbon technologies. Much of their clean air work includes advocating in the US at the state and federal level for regulations of fossil fuel emitting infrastructure in electricity production, industry and transport, but they have also advised several countries on methane regulation development.Their innovation work involves changing the conversation around decarbonisation, and encouraging policymakers, energy researchers and other non-profits to take a technology-agnostic approach to decarbonisation. In addition to this, they run highly effective and pragmatic campaigns to encourage policy support for innovation in these technologies. Much of the innovation work has been in the US, but they have also worked in China and are expanding their work in Europe.

Why do we recommend them?
The Clean Air Task Force is our top pick in climate change. They combine high-quality research on climate policy, with a demonstrated ability to achieve major policy change on a small budget.
They have a strong track record of achieving state and federal policy change in the US in multiple campaigns since their formation.
They focus on innovation in neglected low-carbon technologies, which is our priority climate change intervention. Their project prioritisation aims explicitly to maximise climate impact.
They have a very strong team of policy researchers, technical experts, and policy campaigners.

Overall, the Clean Air Task Force is the most effective organisation we have found at advancing a technology-agnostic energy innovation agenda.
Firstly, they think carefully about project prioritisation and explicitly focus on important but neglected climate solutions. They are guided by what the science says about which solutions are needed in order to solve climate change, rather than following prevailing opinion among other NGOs. Their staff also make contributions to the research and have convened and contributed to numerous highly influential studies that have helped to change the conversation in energy policy circles.1
Secondly, they have an outstanding track record in achieving policy change. We have examined CATF’s track record in some depth by assessing the following campaigns:
Power Plant Campaign and Clear the Air: non-climate pollutants (1996 – 2006).
The Methane Partners Campaign (2000 – present).
Campaign for tax incentives for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) (2009 – 2017).
Campaign for advanced nuclear innovation (ongoing)

To assess these campaigns, we investigated written material and source campaigns and spoke with other NGOs, philanthropists, civil servants and policymakers who were involved. The evidence we collected suggested that CATF played a crucial role in all four campaigns that would have been very difficult for other NGOs to replace. All of these campaigns achieved their initial goals, and CATF conceived of, led or co-led all of them. Their project success rate is highly unusual among organisations that we have assessed.
Moreover, all of these campaigns plausibly have had a large effect on emissions. For example, the tax incentives for CCS will likely abate tens of millions of tonnes of CO2 over the next decade.
Thirdly, there is reason to think that the Clean Air Task Force could have substantial influence on the policies of a possible Biden administration.

After a long hiatus, DISDAT is coming back in Q4 with a couple of changes!

+ monthly cadence instead of a weekly schedule
+ more experiments with $DISDAT
+ DISDAT.eth subdomains for paid subscribers (yearly)
+ private Status group chat 
+ Roam Research Infra Lego Wiki

There's a couple of things I'd like to do before publishing the next release. For starters, backloging all the previous editions from Substack to the more private-focused Ghost. I'd also want to prioritize building the foundation for my Roam Research infra lego wiki that will host the research I do for the newsletter. Then, the Status group chat to host conversations and build a solid community. 

Once I get back into the groove of things again, I'd like to add an audio version of the newsletter for people that prefer to listen. As I find my voice (and get comfortable), I want to try podcasting! I've also been thinking of making how-to/tutorial videos for the greater ecosystem. I also thought doing just dogfooding or just farming streams would be fun to make, too. 

If you'd like to support this grant and my research, please consider donating and sharing! This grant will first be put towards purchasing a mic, webcam, and domain name. I'd also like to set aside some funds to purchase a Raspberry Pi, DAppNode, and potentially other hardware equipment for content-related purposes (ie making videos and writing blogs). Anything left over will be used to seed content related bounties to encourage open participation and collaboration in building the DISDAT brand.

2743,pawnspace-decentralized-nft-collateralized-lendin,"PawnSpace is a decentralized NFT collateralized lending platform, that allows you to convert your NFTs into financial opportunities. The protocol is currently being built on Polygon and the alpha is now LIVE on Mumbai Testnet.
Don't let your NFTs stay idle in your wallet anymore. Collateralize them, and turn your NFTs into financial opportunities! 'Cause, why not? :)

Introduction
With the future of NFTs and its well-needed utility lingering right around the corner, it is a no-brainer to have a way to use your NFTs in such a way that, it no longer stays idle in your wallet, but rather can be used smartly to generate passive income by bridging the NFT and DeFi world.

PawnSpace is a decentralized NFT-collateral lending platform, which primarily functions in a P2P “bid-and-ask” model. This approach allows PawnSpace to not only allow any NFT to be collateralized but also allows the market to decide the valuation of the NFT, and reach a mutual agreement on its valuation, just like in a traditional NFT marketplace. The valuation of an NFT however, may not need to be speculative all the time, consider financial-based NFTs, whose intrinsic value is determined by on-chain verifiable data (for example Uniswap V3 LP tokens). 

PawnSpace allows collateralization of any ERC-721 compliant NFT and any potential loans against it. We are driven by a “let the market decide” approach and intend to keep the platform open for any NFT to be listed on the platform. The “bid-and-ask” approach adopted by the platform conforms to this same notion.

Current forms of NFT Financialization involve fractionalizing NFTs or locking them up in vaults such as NFTX. This however takes away ownership of the underlying asset from the original owner and gives rights to anyone else to claim that NFT. 

Some people may not prefer fractionalizing their NFTs in pools for liquidity since they lose control/ownership of it, but they do not want to sell their NFT in the open market either. 

PawnSpace acts as a gateway for borrowers and lenders to safely and mutually agree on loan conditions and carry them out with smart contracts

User Flow for the Loan



Lock NFT -> Place an Order -> Get Offers -> Approve Offer & Receive Funds -> Repay and Retrieve NFT / Default and Lose NFT.


Key Features
Instant Loan (or auto-accept) - A borrower may choose to provide an “Auto-Accept” or ""Instant Loan"" conditions (loan amount, interest amount, and loan duration). Should a lender agree with these parameters, they may choose to accept the Instant Loan conditions and initialize the loan immediately at the given parameters. This eliminates the necessity for borrowers to manually accept loans, as well as for lenders to wait for their loan to be accepted, and reduces competition with other lenders' Offers.

Debt and Credit tokenization - A key characteristic of PawnSpace is that both the Order and the Offer exist as ERC721 tokens (as Debt Token & Credit Token respectively), meaning borrowers and lenders can dispatch their assets while a loan is in progress. This also opens the possibility of creating derivatives on top of PawnSpace loans (such as CDOs & CCOs), as well as participants in a loan to undergo Credit (or Debt) Delegation, to minimize losses if they lost their borrowed funds through either liquidation or some other reason.

Price Discovery/Valuation - PawnSpace facilitates a value discovery system through a “bid and ask” structure, where borrowers wait and see what offers they receive. Inevitably, loan offers are likely to be below sale prices on other platforms, while borrowers will seek out offers as close to comparable sale prices as possible. PawnSpace will suggest approximate valuations through aggregating and analyzing floor prices through OpenSea.

Completely on-chain and near gasless transactions (built on Polygon) - PawnSpace is completely decentralized by design, with every action happening on-chain. One of the reasons we chose Polygon to launch PawnSpace is because of the in-built decentralization designed into our platform right from the start as Polygon provides cheaper and faster transactions for actions performed on-chain.

We fight DeFi whales to save the world.

WhalerDAO is a community of builders, researchers, legal experts, and community influencers who are dedicated to help solve the plethora of problems that the world is facing, using the power of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi).

We call ourselves whalers, because we intend to take the control of DeFi protocols away from the rich & powerful “whales” and give it into the hands of the people, which is necessary for preventing DeFi from becoming just another tool for the rich to get even richer.
The WhalerDAO Manifesto
The WhalerDAO Blog
Our Discord community

What we do?
Influence - We collaborate with the various DeFi protocols to use governance as an agent for positive sum impact, transitioning from plutocracy to democracy and convincing the communities that DeFi should be used for funding charitable causes. 

Develop - We develop useful tools for the DeFi community to understand how governance power is distributed and how votes are decided.

Research - We do research into novel models of governance and token distribution that prevent the domination of rich & powerful groups and individuals, such as Conviction Voting, Quadratic Voting, Quadratic Funding, and the Windfall Clause 2.

Tree
TREE is the first initiative of WhalerDAO to create a DeFi protocol that benefits charitable causes. 

The value created by TREE will is allocated to several pools, one being a Charity Pool. TREE also serves as the Governance Token of the TREE Charity Pool, meaning TREE holders receive a vote in how the Charity Fund is allocated to each Charity.

Resource on TREE:

Smart Contracts

Goals of our Grant:
So far we are completely self funding. We have launched a DAO on IDChain and have built the Smart Contracts for TREE. Before deploying TREE, we'd like to have the contracts audited first to reduce risk to TREE holders.

WhalerDAO plans for utilizing funding: 
Our plan is to use the donations to help pay for a security audit of the smart contracts used in our first project TREE, an elastic supply token that generates funding for charities. 

The donations we receive in excess will directly fund the charity treasury used by TREE, and will eventually be paid out to charities as decided by TREE holders using Conviction Voting.


If you also believe that we should be working towards how to use DeFi for good, help the ecosystem and fund our grant. This is a community driven project, so we're reaching out to you the community for help.

The world needs banking, but it does not need banks.

At Arboreum, we’re looking to change the way that people access credit.

We enable and maintain credit-lending networks which are funded and utilised by their participants, reducing reliance on formal financial institutions. At the moment, we are specifically targeting regions where informal credit solutions have flourished due to the inability of institutional finance to serve their audience effectively, often due to either geographic distance or insufficient credit history.

Our risk-underwriting model treats the reputation of a borrower as a proxy for their credit score, allowing us to gauge risk and price loans, even in the absence of a formal credit profile. At the core of our solution is the notion of `lines of trust', where trust is defined as the maximum that one is willing to allow another participant to borrow. Borrowers source loans from their direct trust lines, and lenders novate their loan exposure by negotiating lower interest-rate loans from their own trust lines in turn (which repeats as far as possible).

Our product solves a common global problem - even within the United States, a majority of millennials do not have a formal credit score, and legislation such as the SAFE Act has had the unintended consequence of producing significant rejection rates for credit products amongst both millennials and Gen-Z.

Worldwide, 1.8 billion people rely on their family and friends for credit, forced into an informal sector characterised by high interest rates and/or predatory practices, with no way for successful credit usage to be used as a basis for entry into the formal sector. Our product enables borrowers and lenders alike to interact with each other in the informal manner in which most of our users are accustomed to, but also produces a concrete history which can be used as the basis on which a formal credit score can be built.

Progress Since CLR Round 7 Started

After the current round started, we were offered a place in the October cohort of the ConsenSys Labs Tachyon Accelerator (https://labs.consensys.net/tachyon/).

Ultimately, we chose to decline the invitation, as we're slightly further along in development than Tachyon's target audience, but would like to thank ConsenSys for the opportunity!

In addition, we've signed up another two companies - a plastic component manufacturer and a steel castings foundry - and received our first loan request, which we aim to have disbursed before the Gitcoin round ends.

Things are finally moving - thank you all for the support!

------

Development Progress Since CLR Round 6

Let's start off with the really important stuff: we're live! As of two weeks ago, our beta MVP was launched within a solar energy company in Mumbai, India. Said company offers loan facilities to its' employees of up to two months salary, and had previously been offering these loans at zero percent interest. Due to the ongoing pandemic, they noticed that they were receiving a significant increase in simultaneous applications for loans, and could not meet them all. We've stepped in with our own funding pool, and opened up the possibility for fellow employees within the company to add their own funds to the pool in order to receive between 10-20% APR on utilised funds. We'll be sure to provide updates on how this MVP progresses.

More widely, we have another dozen or so companies who have volunteered to pilot our product with their own employees, with headcounts ranging from 50 to upwards of 6,000. This allows us ample opportunity to a) increase our active user base, b) A/B test network parameters, and c) iterate features that are still in development whilst still gathering data from pilots running in parallel. During the roll-out of these additional pilots, we will introduce our pricing model (i.e. initial setup fee, small fees on loan principals disbursed and lender portfolios managed), with the aim of the most cost-effective credit solution within the market.

You can view a demo of our product dashboard by visiting https://app.arboreum.dev/demo - right now, usage of this dashboard is constrained to registered users within our pilots, but it doesn't hurt to be able to look! :)

Model Pivot Since CLR Round 6

In the time since the last Gitcoin round, we have pivoted towards a simpler lending model (with a single lending pool, and the option for people to act as ‘supporters’ for a loan application), and focused on adoption by companies rather than on a user-by-user basis.

The reason for our pivot is that we were finding it difficult to convey the idea of repeatedly novating (taking on intermediate loans at less expensive terms to offset loan exposure) amongst network participants to potential users, despite it being a net benefit for all involved. As such, we’ve retained the core notion of loans being funded by networks, but temporarily dropped the notion of indirect lenders, and introduced the concept of supporters - first-loss-bearing co-lenders who do not put the balance of a loan in escrow. The degree to which these supporters offer to fund a loan directly impacts the interest rate that a borrower receives for the remaining principal (funded by the pool). In exchange for their higher exposure, these supporters receive a higher interest rate than that received by lenders comprising said pool.

Our reason for the focus change in adoption is that many companies in India already offer an ‘emergency loan’ service to their employees where - for example - they can borrow up to twice their monthly salary. Given the pandemic (and the increase in employees simultaneously applying for these loans), we found that we received a great deal more traction by offering the ability to place the funding pool in the hands of employees (akin to a credit union), offering them an additional instrument for investing their funds in a safe environment, and reducing the financial pressure on companies.

We realised that focusing on deploying on this basis - at this stage of our growth - makes more sense than searching for/onboarding users from disparate locations: companies come pre-equipped with their own social networks, and employees of companies that offer these emergency loan services would likely be onboarded as part of the migration from the company-owned service to the employee-owned one. In our current model, supporters must be employees of the same company as the borrower, and risk is reduced by the fact that part of the loan principal is collateralised by the salary of the borrower (as, in the event of default, it is far easier to route funds from a defaulted borrower to their lenders when working within the same payroll system).

We're excited to have you join us.

We ♥ Gitcoin, but we also feel like the dApp ecosystem is missing a user-first, bottom-up way to create, fund, and signal demand for features, enhancements, bug fixes, or even things like security audits. 

We have also noticed that current bounty systems do not encourage continued external developer contribution, and that momentum dies down in between hackathons and Grant Rounds. We hope to complement the great work that Gitcoin is already doing by fostering the creation of project-led ecosystems to tackle the above problems, while still giving projects the ability to tailor Better to their needs (i.e. we do not want to require that projects create DAOs, or require gov tokens, etc.).

2562,dapp-ideas,"  Web3 has forced us to reimagine the world differently, one where gatekeeping and zero sum games are frowned upon while accessibility and positive sum games are made the norm and, in fact, celebrated. To that end, Dapp Ideas is the celebration of human curiosity! The idea is simple, NFTs provide a way to monetize intangibles and enable a standardized marketplace for intangibles, all together or by category (music, art, you get the idea).

  Dapp Ideas aims to enable anybody to ask a question, one whose answer their soul is longing for, and then find kindred spirits to seek the answer to that question. Once the question is answered, the answer is released, open source, to the public and the question, minted as an NFT, is available for purchase by the highest bidder. This serves two purposes — i. It ensures that the original seeker is compensated for the idea they brought into reality; and ii. Money is humanity's tool to compress a lot of information into a simple number, for easy comparisons. Having an NFT tied to a question ensures a way for us to see how valuable humanity deems the question (or even the answer found for the question).

  Of course, inspired by Gitcoin, Dapp Ideas will have quadratic matching capabilities, with a twist. Anyone may start a quadratic matching fund for a collection of grants (NFTs), in addition to, we hope, network organized ones every quarter (similar to Gitcoin CLRs). The idea here is that anyone with a little funds could start a matching pool and create a collection of grants. If the collection be so intriguing, the pool gets funds from the community. As a result, even the small players can have a say in what gets funded, so long as their reasoning is sound. And isn't web3 all about moving beyond money?

  If questions seem quite abstract, it could be as serious as pursuing a new scientific breakthrough, or as silly as what does RDJ have for breakfast. The idea is to have a platform to raise questions that bother one's curiosity, and enable them to satisfy that urge. Curiosity may have killed the cat, but satisfaction surely brought it back. Dapp Ideas hopes to satisfy our (and your) curiosities and bring you back from [metaphorical] death!

Hello friend, I'm Nelson and since 2009, I✍️write✍️ about technologies, economics, politics, among other topics. Since 2014 I put a lot of emphasis on bitcoin, although lately on the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem through different projects. In 2020 I did a project reform and changed everything to start calling it La Hora Cripto.

Weekly Newsletter: My main idea is to make an editorial about topics that arise in the week or the month. I try to make them as basic and simple as possible. If there is something that I appreciate, it is reading good content and I want to give you that.
Blog: You will find almost six years and more than 50 articles dedicated -mostly- to bitcoin. Each of them, I have carefully reviewed over time and keep it updated as much as possible.

And what am I looking for? In recent years my writing level has dropped and it is simply my day-to-day work. Unfortunately, I must prioritize other -paid- activities because although I do this with all the ❤️love❤️ in the world, my internet service does not accept my enthusiasm or love as part of payment 😭

Oh oh, now I want to introduce the course Intro to BTC 101, when someone ask you how to start, you show it this course:

👉Intro to Bitcoin 101[SPA]👈

The long-term goal is to become sustainable enough so that I can spend more time creating new content.

Did I think about selling ads? 🧐 A multitude of times I even thought about selling advertising space in my newsletter but I must be honest:

I hate ads

What if I don't have money? 🤔

Money is not everything. You can support me by subscribing, sharing content or showing your WA/TG ​/Discord groups this newsletter. I thank you for taking your time to share.

What are your plans for the future? Oh, big. If you help me, I intend to:

Launch a bitcoin 101 course: In fact, I'm already doing it. I am staying but one thing B E A U T I F U L
Launch a manual to get started with cryptocurrencies: I've already been writing almost 50 pages but I need to pay for an editor, a designer for the cover.
Write more frequently: If your excitement of sharing translates into money, I will be able to spend more time writing. It is a win-win. (DONE)
Buying animation software: By the end of September, what started as a podcast project looks prettier for making videos. I am taking all the courses to bring better content.

Goals follow-up (Achieved thanks to your previous contributions)

REACHED 100 SUBSCRIBERS: I owe a large part of that effort to the community who have joined and have given me a lot of feedback. Very thankful. And I did this three months after entering here.

2438,earth-rising-the-game,"This is a design for a game.
In this project, the players in a rich multimedia setting are challenged to save the world within an hour and a half. In doing so, account must be taken of the interests and objectives of both humanity and the government. To set priorities and make
choices, the players will work in teams. Through the reality content and the use
of multimedia, we want to push the existing boundaries with ""EARTH RISING"" and renew the genre of serious gaming.

The gaming industry has long ceased to be an attic niche. Global sales last year
were approximately $ 120 billion, more than twice that of the entire film
industry. Fortnite alone managed to fish $ 2.4 billion from the wallets of -
especially young - gamers. Those same youngsters really don't play all day,
which their parents often fear. The rest of the day they watch games on
YouTube or Twitch. On YouTube alone, around 200 million people watch video
every day about games.
The staggering numbers make it clear that the interests of game makers are
great. Inspired in part by the success of Fortnite, they all try to sell the next
success. One of the latest successes is Electronic Arts' Apex Legends game. This
free game managed to attract 25 million players within one week. The
marketing is extremely effective. We want to respond to that.




Background project
Google play is there, which is interesting.
The idea is that everyone can play on existing equipment (mobile phone, laptop,
TV). A special console like the PlayStation or Xbox, nor downloading and
installing games are necessary. That is our basis.

Project content
Project result
Viewers should be persuaded to start gaming with the push of a button. If
successful, Google taps into a new group of customers who will pull the wallet
for a monthly subscription service. Our game responds to this.
Fortnite was the best-earning game ever with $ 2.4 billion in revenue in 2018,
research firm SuperData recently announced. Not thanks to people who buy the
game, because Fortnite is free. The makers earn money by selling costumes and
dances for the doll you play with. And selling challenges that, when completed,
lead to even more suits and dances.

Just buy a game and play? That is no longer the standard. Game makers now
earn a good deal of their money with additional purchases in the game. It is not
without reason that ""free"" games brought in just under $ 88 billion (77 billion
euros) in 2018, 80 percent of all money earned with video games, according to
SuperData. Even with non-free games, offering additional options for a fee has
become a standing practice.

Step 1: Earth Rising lets people play with each other
The very first screen that Earth Rising presents, we encourage players to add
friends, ""to complement your team"".
We believe it is the reason that Candy Crush shows scores of other players after
every game round. That Earth Rising urges you to join a ""crew"", a kind of club
with other players. That the same game awards extra points when you complete
missions (save the earth) with a friend.
After all, social connection is one of the psychological needs that games can
meet, please note that this has been proven. Others are a sense of competence,
it feels good to face challenges, and autonomy, the sense of control and
freedom of choice. Whether you approach the opponent stealthily through the
bushes or by rushing towards it at full speed, for example.

Step 2: Earth Rising allows players to dress up
The sense of autonomy and social connection are stronger if you have your own
identity in the game, according to Canadian research from 2016. The
researchers had test subjects play a game in which they ran endlessly across a
path to collect coins. Players running around with a self-designed avatar, the
puppet you play with, played longer than those who didn't.
GTA Online makes use of this by offering clothes for a fee. After the first race
and the first mission, your navigation system will send you directly to a clothing
store. To pick up the outfits you got when you bought the game. And to show
what other cool stuff you can buy. That is interesting, we want to anticipate this
further with our project.

Step 3: Earth Rising puts time pressure on players
How do you get ""skins"", like outfits in Fortnite are called? You can also buy a
part here in the store. Note the mention ""Another 13 hours."" After that, the
pickaxe that looks like a squid is no longer available. ""They deliberately create
scarcity,"" which is irritating. With an exclusive look you want to be seen on the
battlefield. You have to pull the wallet now, of course. But this is not necessary
with us. We think we will approach this in a smarter way.

A second way to get skins is to win them by collecting points. This is done,
among other things, by achieving goals, along the lines of ""shoot seven people
with a gun. Paying players are promised a large amount of rewards. At the end
you can play as the Ice King, so you will be rewarded, we want to apply this if
you make good choices then you will be rewarded.

Delineation of the project result
Conspiracy has long been associated with eccentric figures in the attic, but the
question now arises: is the number of conspiracy thinkers growing? Or have
they always been there, but are they only now able to find prominent stages?
Rather, conspiracy thinking is only seen now. Especially since a president came
to power in 2016 who spread one theory after another: that vaccinations cause
autism or that climate change does not exist. ""In the past, conspiracy thinking
was seen as a fringe phenomenon. It never was. It has always been a
widespread phenomenon. ""Earth Rising responds to this, it is about conspiracy
theory. We do not want to frighten people, but take the fear away by means of
the game and let the player discover his own creativity, thereby also his own
abilities.

Requirements
Current conspiracy thinking focuses on modern society and our own institutions.
It is about the elite, the medical industry, our government leaders, the
vaccinations that our children receive. We want to mirror people in the game,
let the player experience that they are capable of much more than they think
now. Earth Rising is a thinking game, a kind of tool to bring people closer to
themselves. We need a team for this, a think tank. A project team

Activities of the parties involved
We are a close team of creative minds and conquer the world with our
impactful projects from the Ports of Rotterdam. Founded twenty years ago by
one creative person, it has grown into a professional and innovative multi-media
company. With a good mix of forty extra fanatics, we are committed to changing
behavior through play and our knowledge and skills. With extensive experience
in various sectors such as education, healthcare and (large) business companies,
we serve a versatile market at home and abroad.

Interfaces with other projects / activities
Over the years we have built up a great portfolio with a wide variety of issues
and solutions. We always work with great pleasure and passion on our projects,
but are only really satisfied when we actually make an impact.

An effective tool
Well and carefully designed gamification - as we are going to apply it - is an
extremely effective tool for thinking with immediate and real impact on
behavior. Why?
• It directly leads to behavioral change.
• It creates support, because we work bottom up: in co-creation with customer
and end user.
• It has real impact on human happiness.
• It is applicable to all challenges related to human behavior.

Project management
Money
programmer: 4 weeks x 40 hours = 160 hours
2d design: 2 weeks x 40 hours = 80 hours
collect content by experts: 2 weeks x 40 hours
put online and 1 test with end users: 20 hours
last corrections and unforeseen: 40 hours

So you arrive at 340 hours as a rough estimate. Without promotion and
""marketing"" of the game, without major setbacks (from computer crash to
versions of PHP that do not cooperate or bugs in the software) and without
hours for a project manager or game designer. If you assume a (cheap) rate of
50 euros per hour, you are already on a budget of 15,000 euros.

Organization
The team
The team needed to create Earth Rising usually consists of the following roles:
• A game designer: the person who comes up with the game idea and / or
develops it into programmable game rules
• Matter experts: the experts who understand the subject of the Earth Rising
(teachers, scientists, psychologists, etc.)
• Programmers: those who will technically realize the game
• Game artists: the people who produce the pictures (2d and sometimes 3d)
• Possibly: game sound engineers (if the sound is important, otherwise you will
work with available sound databases.
• A project leader: if it concerns a large team
• Test audience
• The publisher or administrator of the game
Then charge a rate of 50-100 euros per hour (ex. VAT) for each of the above
persons and you will already have an idea how quickly your budget can go.

Quality
We have developed our own proven methodology, based on the most
substantiated behavioral theories. The end user is central to this, in order to
achieve real impact. We believe in the power of games and games as a
development and change tool. Whether it is raising awareness, learning new
skills or practicing new behaviors to create habits. Play is never the goal, but the
means.

Information
A monthly progress report will be made for the client. In this report, Chapter 1
will discuss the content of the project and Chapter 2 will report the control
(GOKIT) of the project.

Time
12 months is the total lead time and the end date of the total project. 2 months
is lead time and end date per phase. The execution and cooperation of the team
are possibly limiting factors.

Collaboration
Through weekly consultation and interaction within the team, all parties remain
involved and on the right course.

Risk analysis
Potential risks
Predicting the future is an impossibility. With so many uncertainties that will
each have an influence on what is to come, it is pointless to make a hard
forecast. Yet a pattern seems to be emerging that gives an idea of where the
industry is headed. With the advent of Season Passes and DLC, it seems that
games are going to be much more of a dynamic service than a static product like
we saw in the past. As games become more expensive but the selling price
remains the same, something has to change to remain viable for companies.

Risk reducing measures
In the above description, the greatest (financial) risk lies with the publishers.
However, there are also plenty of examples where the programmers themselves
have been largely or even entirely responsible for making their games
profitable. With this they take a huge risk where a personal bankruptcy is not
even the worst thing that can happen to them. We can reduce this by sharing
responsibility.

🔋 About TE Academy

The mission of the TokenEngineering (TE) Academy is to provide structured education both to individuals and the ecosystem at large, in order to help blockchain projects get access to know-how and resources for establishing a rigorous Token Engineering process.
The goal of token engineering as a discipline is to design and create cryptoeconomic systems that are robust against exploits, unintended consequences, and cascade failures. Token Engineering draws from established practices in Systems Engineering as well as Behavioral & Ecological Economics, Operations Research, AI & Optimization. The Token Engineering Community has been active since 2018, conducting meetups and workshops, collecting and digesting relevant research in the sector, and offering a platform to collaborate.

they track the price of all the assets listed in Jarvis.market: fiat currencies, indexes, bullion, stocks etc.;
Synthereum leverages from UMA's priceless framework which reduces the oracle usage: it allows minting at the real-time market price;
they are backed by DAI, allowing to leverage seamlessly from multiple existing integration: fiat on/off-ramp, dex, liquidity pools, etc.
they can be converted between them using a burn and minting mechanism;
the collateral is provided by a a liquidity pool matching user's deposit; user only needs to deposit the exact value of the assets, and the pool is responsible for over-collateralizing the contract, and maintaining the collateral ratio;
hence liquidity providers are the counterpart; they lose funds whenever user wins, and vice-versa; they can hedge their exposure using Margineum, our trust-minimized off-chain trading protocol, which allows to open long/short position on Forex, Indexes, etc.;
liquidity providers receive the interest generated on the collateral deposited in Compound by the collateral as well as the fees paid by users while minting assets.

Accomplishment

We already have a v0 on Kovan using Chainlink for price feed: https://bit.ly/30OtjfZ with a single liquidity provider; more info about the v0: https://bit.ly/2UogDZP; and small dAPP: https://bit.ly/2zA7yp7;
We have now completed our v1 using UMA's priceless contract: https://bit.ly/2MYXg4K which also introduces the usage or Relayers; we will soon publish an article and launch our dAPP Jarvis.exchange.

Roadmap:

As you all know, it is hard to give an accurate timeline so we will avoid doing that.

we will adopt the UMA's priceless framework in order to mitigate the front-running risk and to minimize the use of oracles (CHECK)
we will launch a uniswap-like (under development);
we will integrate with Paraswap Dex's aggregator to connect our synthetics with all the other liquidity pools and protocols;
we will be adding few thousands instrument, starting this year with fiat: EUR, CHF, GBP, JPY, NZD, CAD, AUD, ZAR, CNH, CZK, HKD, SGD, RUB, TRY, MXN, DKK, SEK, PLN, ILS;
we will then be adding europeans, asiatics and american stocks and indexes;
we will then open the pooling system to allow anyone to become a liquidity provider;
we will build an automated dealing desk system to automate the hedging.

Curaçao had it's first Black revolution over 50 years ago on May 30th 1969. After slavery was abolished in 1863, black Curaçaoans continued to face racism and discrimination. They did not participate fully in the riches resulting from Curaçao's economic prosperity and were disproportionately affected by the rise in unemployment.

Currently structural inequality and racism are still ever-present on the island and as a result of COVID-19 the economy is projected to shrink drastically (unemployment is projected to reach 42% before the year ends). 

Structural change is needed. Instead of demanding change from the old system, our community aims to create a new, open and equal foundation from scratch using future proof values and designs.

With your support we will continue to advance the following projects to support, educate and empower the local population, especially those who are facing racial inequality.

CuraDAO: Social-impact DAO that supports grass root initiatives that create sustainable development on the island.
CuraDAI: Complementary currency that matches the local FIAT currency in terms of unit of account.
Innovation Ç: Collective of innovators and activists who facilitate systems innovation on the island.
Donut Economics Taskforce: Task force aimed at introducing doughnut economics frameworks into the local economy.

Growdrop is a crowdfunding solution that minimizes the trust costs of existing third parties, deposits investment funds into DeFi Lending Protocol’s liquidity pool, contributing interest to open source projects and ensuring investor principal. 

If the initial token project is not listed or there is no use, the token from Growdrop can be uploaded to uniswap to set the listing and price. You can do “uniswap creat exchange& add liquidity to uniswap ” for a certain amount of tokens and interest to those who distribute to the Growdrop pool.

The project will slowly build communities to help promote public relations and technology development. Here, in the early Ethereum community, it was very similar in nature to DAICO.

Growdrop Donation:model: The Donation model is similar to the token distribution model, where supporters secure tokens in Growdrop so that the interest generated there is raised to the donated foundation. Supporters will receive ERC-721-based donate certificates and principals. This will help to realize a donating model that minimizes risk through principal guarantees.

798,a-hitchhikers-guide-to-token-engineering,"""A Hitchhiker's Guide to Token Engineering“ is a crowdsourced and crowdfunded book and online content repo for token designers, entrepreneurs and applied researchers to get the hang of Token Engineering. The book aims at giving the full account of experience with an end-to-end tool chain: from co-designing the digital ecosystem through games, to mapping the territory, to not mistaking the map for the territory. It's full of cautious tales, as well as the soothing layout of a tool chain and process that will assist you in designing, modeling, simulating, securely deploying, governing, and upgrading a token economy - building on the transdisciplinary foundations of cryptoeconomics. This is going to be a hell of a ride.

We're establishing a process by which authors present, get feedback, and share a write up or abstract in the newsletter. To stay up to date with planned feedback session, make sure you get emails from this grant or subscribe to the newsletter.

Updates:

All authors have a lot on their plate rn - but this was a challenge we all accepted knowing it won't be easy to be full-time in token economies, related work and finding time to cohere. Curation, Communication, Coordination turn out to be lifeblood of not just this community sourced book, but also decentralizing organizations in general. 

It seems we all need to be upskilled in Permissionless Participation, on how to improvise or careograph individual contributions into actual collaborations in a decentralized manner - without a conductor. I remember many of us making fun of Iota's conductor ;) but in reflection: has progressive decentralization really integrated the BDFL? 

Progress since last Gitcoin round has been mainly in intake of ""case studies"", many of which will result in direct insights and useful knowledge commons for Token Engineering - in any case, these are different 

Ch2. Transdisciplinary Art of Token Engineering: Remember TEC#0mega creating initiatives like the TE Consilience Library, whilst researching Self-Organization and Regenerative Workflows? Not only is it one of the most diverse groups in web3 but also inclined not to give in into ""follow the leader"" but lean in to ""finding direction"" as individual and collective, as contributors and collaborators in an emergent manner.

Ch3 & Ch4. Cryptoeconomics Patterns & Applications and Token Model Generation: we have joined the Call for Participation in the ReFi Bootcamp of Longtail Financial. (a) these peer learning environments are wonderful community service (b) it helps us round the content and write down the insights. And if you ever participated in any of Ecosystem Valueflows Courses you know that we always had many regenerative projects looking for a foothold how to make use of tokenization. Alongside the LTF bootcamp we'll share more writing and also open source the TE Academy TMG1 materials.

Ch7 & Ch8. Legal Engineering and Decentralizing Organizations: with just too much going on in regulatory environment, we didn't manage to organize live sessions. But a template is on its way, it is inspired by Steward Ownership and the A16z Legal Framework for DAOs, essentially decomposing Token Engineering into its practical components: Community Cohesion - Legal Engineering - Financial Engineering - Software Engineering... It's all about communication (i.e. information flows)

Ch5 & 6 are getting framed exactly in this tension: Participatory and Privacy Preserving Architectures becoming ""Permissionless Participation & Privacy"" and SecDevOps still needs fermenting, but if you see the hint like I do: SecDevOps is the principle, the foundation of the practical components mentioned above. I personally haven't jumped through the ID hoops that's why your contribution to the book doesn't get the matching it might get - but means a lot!

Epilogue: An Interface to Moral Philosophy for Token Engineers, is still being nurtured in TE Ethics Participatory Action Research in TEC#0mega - but will flow into writing during this round, too!

We are always happy to receive your support, not only in funding but also in words of appreciation and help communicating our spirit. Thanks ! 
 
 
Hey everyone! 

We’re excited to announce our first ever Gitcoin Grant application.

If you’ve yet to experience some POAP magic - you may recall receiving an NFT badge at one of the many Ethereum events we’ve been blessed to partner with. Some highlights (in a visually appealing order) include:

EthCC (Paris, France)
Devcon (Osaka, Japan)
Dappcon (Berlin, Germany)
EthDenver (Colorado, USA)
EthGlobal (Waterloo, Boston, Bangalore, London, etc)

What is POAP?

POAP - short for Proof of Attendance Protocol - provides event nomads with a way to verify their attendance through collecting digital badges, all of which live onchain. Each badge is unique, meaning that the only way to claim one is to physically (or digitally) receive it at the event.

For those of you who love to flex all the Ethereum events you’ve attended over the past year, POAP is your ticket for ultimate crypto clout.

It seems like people like to flex, as we’ve distributed roughly 7000 badges across more than 60 coveted events.

Why Gitcoin Grants?

While our journey has been incredible, what you might not know is that the entire project has been volunteer oriented, meaning we’ve funded everything - both time and money - in house. We’ve turned down ETH Killers and other avenues which we felt tarnished the purity of what we’re looking to build.

This means that everything from gas cost wars to travel, distribution and dealing with Japanese customs accusing us of smuggling drugs has been out of pocket due to our love for Ethereum and the wider community. 

We’ve been lucky enough to work with and receive support from Ethereum’s best and brightest talents, all of which are highlighted in POAP’s journey since its creation at ETHDenver in 2019.

While we're extremely saddened by the fact that all of our events where we planned to bring our magic have been cancelled or postponed because of Covid-19, we won’t let it detour our wizardry! 

While in quarantine, we’ve been heads down working on adding new features, governance tools and enhanced swag to hit the Ethereum circuit in full force in the coming years! 

Using POAP we can:

Host targeted airdrops to badge recipients of specific events
Use badges as sentimental collateral for lending
Allow badges to be used as proxy for special governance polls
Partner with projects like Kickback for unique redemption schemas
Crown the “Ethereum Vagabond” based on the number of events attended

The possibilities are truly endless and we plan on using our Gitcoin Grant funding to help expand our ecosystem awareness and build out a suite of killer features to take the project to the next level.

If you’ve ever gotten some POAP swag and want to express your appreciation, this is your chance! 

Any amount you donate (one time or recurring) is very welcome.

Thanks!

It also provides a way for the wealth that is produced locally to benefit the relevant local people, rather than being siphoned off to distant companies or economies. 

🌱 Fair economic sustainability of all people in the world while regenerating the earth
👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨 Collaboration rather than competition between all the serious efforts to bring currencies with an inclusive purpose to the mainstream
🌍 Accessible currency ecosystem providing education & tooling to design, simulate, deploy, using, monitoring and / or governing community currencies


Launching the Community Currency Accelerator, targeting the 3 biggest blockers of the community currency ecosystem

Based on the findings of our survey, we have identified 🎓 education, 📱 infrastructure and 📖 framework to be the main blockers which today on an international scale hinders the community currency ecosystem from unleashing its full potential. For this purpose we have launched the Community Currency Accelerator and awarded the 6 first grants to 6 projects / contributors working to solve the above challenges.

2574,dissecting-defi-protocols,"I am a developer who has been learning Solidity online. After going through various introductory courses, I realized there are no advanced tutorials on how DeFi actually works on the code level. Knowing that most DeFi protocols are open-source, I decided to visit different protocols' GitHub codebases and read their smart contracts. I know many developers have similar experience when trying to learn Solidity, so I started the newsletter ""Dissecting DeFi Protocols"" to explain how things work under the hood. It is not enough to just learn the language, but also how the smart contracts are stitched together to form a protocol.

3062,atlantis-world,"Atlantis World is building the Web3 social metaverse by connecting Web3 with social, gaming and education in one lightweight virtual world that’s accessible to everybody.

Essentially, a mobile-ready pixel metaverse that could be stored on a pen drive and played seamlessly on most devices (even an old laptop), combining social features with incentivised interactive learning to onboard users into the Web3 ecosystem. 

From creating a first ever Web3 wallet, connecting to new blockchain RPCs (we rebuilt chainlist.org inside of the game so users can connect to new chains with 3 or 4 clicks), depositing into DeFi markets, trading assets on DEXs, trading NFTs using popular marketplaces and voting in DAOs… all is possible inside of Atlantis World in a gamified way. 

We’re building quests and designing incentives so that users can be rewarded for interacting with and learning about these kinds of applications and use cases in-game. 

Imagine every time a user is guided through the process of using a DeFi protocol by a scripted non-player character, exploring the Web3 ecosystem as an MMORPG game world, they might earn some tokens, an NFT badge or wearable or an in-game perk (such as a mount, super-power or any other kind of experience enhancer). DAOs could also leverage this to increase participation in their governance, especially when combined with other Atlantis World features like token-gating and voice chat!

Beyond that, a core focus of ours is climate solutions and we're currently building a carbon capturing virtual forest inside of Atlantis World, creating an in-game carbon black hole and gamification / social proof system around carbon offsetting.

3497,fracton-incubation-2022,"Fracton Incubation is the first Japan focused Web3.0 incubation program created by Fracton Ventures.

Fracton Ventures is one of the most active Web3.0 / DAO committed teams in Japan. We have been part of the NEAR India acceleration program as a community partner and startup mentors.
Back to the main topic, we launched Fracton Incubation 2021 last year. 

We have been talking to a lot of Crypto VCs and Accelerators. At this point, we couldn't reply concretely when they asked us which projects are great Web3.0 projects in Japan. The reason is simple, there is NO Web3.0 dedicated ecosystem/support such as investments, legal framework, government support etc. in Japan. So we have started this incubation program to target this issue.

This is the first Web3.0 focused incubation program in Japan. And this year, we have decided we won't take any of the shares/tokens from the selected project because the ecosystem still hasn't evolved to the business incubation level but are slowly reaching that point. That is the reason why we need this grant so we can continue to support projects even though they are not yet at the business incubation level and would be critical to maintain our operations and activities.

Details of Fracton Incubation 2021 (We are creating 2022 website right now!):
Website: https://fine2021.studio.site/ We will provide mentoring and support from Sep 2021 to Dec 2021. This is the first Web3.0 focused incubation program in Japan. We have finished the applications phase. We will announce the selected projects in early September. We will hold the first DEMO DAY in Dec 2021. We already have a gold sponsor from one of the big Japanese crypto exchange bitbank.

Use of grants:
We will spend the fund to engage more startups in Fracton Incubation and help build stronger communities (in number and activity) for the startups as well as for the general Web3.0 and DAO ecosystem in Japan. We will publicly announce how much we raise in funds from the community as well.

Updated:
We will host the DEMODAY of this incubation program on mid of Dev.
The announcement is here.

About Fracton Ventures:
We have been fully committed to Web3.0 / DAO field globally but especially in Japan. We have supported NEAR India Accelerator with NEAR protocol as a support company/mentor. We have been co-creating cooperative Web3.0 projects along with major B2B players in Japan. One of them is MetaTokyo which works with one of the biggest Japanese Kawaii culture music / talent management company to create the first massive Metaverse project in Tokyo based out of Harajuku. Second is that we are working with the Japan's only pro swimming team (ISL) known as Tokyo Frog Kings led by the famous Japanese Gold Medallist Olympian swimmer. Our interview about our plan of working as and promoting DAOs is published on Decrypt. Website: https://fracton.ventures/

Our Slogan: We can DAO it. 

Hopefully, the community will support us in our challenges ahead!

4093,elephant-in-the-room-green-pill-campaign,"Elephant in the Room is a decentralized think tank that creates multimedia campaigns to move the needle on climate change. Working with Indigenous organizations, voting organizations, neighborhoods, cities and activists to promote climate action to communities around the world and to counter the vast array of fossil fuel advertising and disinformation.

Over the past 2 months Elephant Room has laid the foundation for a strategic communications campaign focused on ""taking the green pill"" within the web3 community. More targeted communications within the ""general public"" will follow in the months to come. 

The first short climate communication with implications for Web3 will be promoting public goods and climate especially as it relates to Gitcoin's GR14 Climate round. 

Short promo piece for Gitcoin Climate Solutions is out now.




Strategic messaging about the climate crisis needs to be around every corner including the corners of Web3 and yet, they are oddly absent. Even with a worsening situation every day, well under 1 percent of overall broadcast news coverage was devoted to climate change last year and a majority of people still report that they rarely talk about climate change with their friends and family.





While the majority of people understand that climate change is real, there is still no feeling of urgency and rarely are people aware of the solutions available to us…our mission is to change that. making the solutions real and tangible for people. We need a major shift in our approach to communications around the climate crisis. In order to do that we connect the dots for people on the things that motivate them to act; finding the inroads in specific communities around urgency, step-by-step solutions, and alternatives.



We “fill the gaps” by organizing and implementing the type of strategic campaigns that no one else is doing. Working both independently as well as with other nonprofits, First Nations/Native Americans, governments of all sizes and other partners to spread awareness, motivate change, find common ground and make solutions a reality.

Our campaigns are local, involve existing networks and grassroots organizations and both air and ground games. We utilize digital platforms as well as traditional and in person methods to create a sense of community involvement as well as political mandate. We also work to incorporate important messaging into existing media (TV, Film, radio, podcasts etc.)

What's next?

We will run a Green Pill campaign in the Web3 space focusing on converting people into solarpunks working together for a better future. This campaign will also help people understand how web3 can play a key role in making this transition possible. 



We will run targeted climate solutions campaigns in various locations in North America and internationally as well as producing reports outlining their impacts.

We will work collaboratively with others to continue to refine best practices and resources available to help any group or individual more clearly communicate about climate change and climate solutions related to their community.



We have worked on hundreds of campaigns over the past 25 years ranging from stopping destructive mega projects at the community level to actively participating in and speaking at world summits; always with the goal of changing the conversation especially with those not already in the conversation.




What problem do we address? 

We address the elephant in the room. Looking for ways to communicate and dialog with people about climate solutions that are usually left out of the conversation. We work with indigenous groups, immigrants, farmers and those about to be sunset out of energy jobs. We work with diversity, equity and inclusion groups as well as social and climate justice organizations. We are constantly testing what works and what doesn’t work; where the polarity lies and how to stop the divisiveness that has infiltrated every conversation. 




How we address it?

Our goal through each of our campaigns is to turn apathy, fear, and discord into action, cooperation and ultimately, heroism. 
A few examples of our work includes;

The Great Climate Race
A 10, and 2k virtual race and road race on the Vancouver waterfront and peer to peer crowdfunding web app to raise funds per mile for renewable energy projects

4257,reputable-dao,"Overview

Reputable is a Web3 community & platform where members run personal health & wellness experiments and share their real world data to help validate potential treatments/therapies.

Problem

Chronic disease is exploding and traditional healthcare is not keeping up with the rising costs associated to managing chronic disease. It still takes over a decade to bring new drugs to market (Mullard 2014). Moreover, it can take up to 30 years for a treatment to become standard of care. For people with serious health conditions, that wait time can feel cruelly long.

The wellness & betterment industry has grown rapidly to address the current frustration in healthcare developments. People are finding information online from many sources and starting to take matters into their own hands. The challenge with online sources of information is it’s hard to know what to believe and who to trust. Without real world data, we cannot credibly determine  what is 'better'.  

The Need

We need a decentralized system that empowers people to share their real world efficacy data on the personal wellness experiments they conduct.  One that is fully transparent, without the shackles of ownership. One where curation is prioritized over control. ​

Why this is important

We realized that it doesn't matter how much healthcare innovation is happening. If we can't solve for ""what's better?"", we're stuck. This is the status quo. Billions spent. Time wasted. Lives lost. Reputation is the lynchpin needed to unlock all the value created in health & wellness. ​ 

How we solve this problem

This is a moon shot, but it is also solvable. It just needs like-minded individuals and organization to come onboard and push against the status quo.  We are building this community in Discord.  Please join us: https://discord.gg/DBtgTqvgAG

What have we accomplished since Grant 12?

Since our initial grant 12 application, we've accomplished the following:
Raised an additional 6 ETH within the founding team
Focused on collecting real world datasets to credibly determine 'better'
Launched an NFT campaign to reward our top contributors in the community
Updated our website and created a whitepaper
Defined the UX for the Reputable platform where experiments are run and results observed

What the Gitcoin funds will be used for?

We will be using the funds to build the platform that members use in creating experiments and sharing results with the world.",http://reputable.health,31,30,0,1,0,https://github.com/reputable-guy,5

818,metis-protocol-a-governance-and-collaboration-imp,"Painpoints to solve: Currently, we are building the Metis Protocol, which is a governance and collaboration implementation framework for DAOs.  DAO is a great idea and practice, so we hope to bring it to a much wider audience - internet communities (may not in the blockchain/cyrpto field), and then we found that it is still of high stake (wallet, tokens, systems or DApps development needed) for the general internet communities to launch a DAO. And for the internet communities, voting (which most DAOs' governance protocols are focusing on) is only a small fraction of all the use scenarios. Instead, they are more caring about how to buildup the collaborations with other trustless distributed collaborators and get things done, and how to protect the interest for all the collaborators. So, there is a big gap between the current DAO governance protocols and real needs.

Solutions: Metis Protocol hopes to bridge the gap via below mechanisms:
 
Metis Protocol builds on an optimistic assumption that every distributed collaborator will act professionally to deliver what they promised promptly, and with the promised quality. So, Metis Protocol defines the Meta Staking Contract(MSC),  which leverages staking as the foundation of governance (relationship establishing, disputes resolving, and collaboration terminating among these distributed collaborators). Their collaboration relationship is established and activated after they staked some kinds of tokens onto the MSC (just like deposit onto a 3rd party escrow account). The stakes will act as the commitment and will be returned(along with the incentives and reputation power) if everything goes well. However, if something goes wrong in the process, the hidden governance mechanism will be triggered, the MSC will be frozen, the off-chain Arbitrator will jump out to help, and the deposit of the “bad party” will be forfeited to repay the “good party”, the reputation power of the “bad party” will be downgraded as well. The 'presumption of innocence' principle of the Metis Protocol makes it worry-free for these unacquainted distributed collaborators to establish the collaboration conveniently.
 
Metis Protocol also designs the ComCo Management Framework, with which off-chain and digitalized tools will be used to implement the collaborations, and all the implementation has the track record on the blockchain to serve the governance mechanism. Collaboration management are placed onto the Optimistic Roll sidechain (high scalability, low cost, high privacy)to bridge the gap between off-chain value creation activities and on-chain governance. Distributed collaborators negotiate and confirm the collaboration details off the chain, then record the critical milestone information into the Transactions Statement Contract(TSC, deployed on the side chain) as the witness. The Framework also has the Microservice Tools Pool (MTP) to provide various microservice tools and APIs(wallet, wiki, chatroom, collaboration, compliance, etc.) for distributed collaborators to execute different business activities. The execution result of different stages will be stored as the track record and confirmed off the chain, and the updated state of the TSC will be synchronized to the main chain, which will trigger the MSC to allocate budget/incentives or call arbitration.
 
Metis Protocol synergizes the merits from the Staking Economy, Optimistic Rollup, Smart Contract, and Microservice Framework, and also is thinking from the perspectives of the user experience, which will help to foster a simplified, fair, protectable, practical, and high-privacy environment for the Ethereum ecosystem to govern and manage distributed collaborations. 
 
We hope to help the Ethereum ecosystem to cover more business scenarios. Operation teams(easy to launch a DAO and activate the community), distributed collaborators(worry-free environment to collaborate with others), and developers(ready-to-use APIs, templates, tools) in the Internet Communities, Blockchain Applications, Sharing Economy, Gig Economy, etc. will get benefit from our work.
 
Defi will also get benefit from the Metis Protocol. Community members can stake or invest in different collaborative projects based on the track record of the project and the team, and can pull back their investment if something went wrong. So Defi users can gain access to the project value (win-win for both sides), while not just staking some tokens to gain the interest.

All in all, We hope Metis Protocol could be one of the backbone layer 2 protocols of the Ethereum ecosystem and contribute for the public good to boost the explosive development of Web 3.

4193,defi-daos-and-law-keeping-a-finger-on-the-pulse,"Uninformed regulations harm the crypto space. There's still a lot of FUD around DeFi and decentralized governance: we hear lawmakers and regulators talk about a 'Wild West', speculation-driven actors and the need for consumer protection.

However, there's so much more to DeFi and DAOs that legal decision-makers need to understand.

We need to show how crypto, DeFi and DAOs can help achieve regulatory goals. Reducing transaction costs, lowering barriers to entry, mitigating information asymmetry and reducing agency costs in governance – these are the concepts lawmakers and regulators are very familiar with. We need to speak their language to explain how crypto can contribute to achieving those goals.

That’s our strength at CryptoLaw. We speak legalese. And we’ve studied the theory of the firm, law & economics, financial and behavioural game theory, corporate law, financial market regulation and competition law. And, of course, DeFi, DAOs, DLT and crypto in general. 

CryptoLaw was founded by a former practising lawyer and legal academic, with the ability to bridge the world of crypto and that of lawmakers. Ann Sofie started doing this by teaching a course on crypto & law at Cambridge, but it’s time to bring that knowledge to a wider audience: those deciding on the legal fate of crypto, DeFi and DAOs.

The crypto community has great teams doing excellent crypto advocacy work. Coin Center has been doing important work around the Infrastructure Bill while EFF is carrying out crucial advocacy work on privacy rights. CryptoLaw complements those efforts with a focused legal contribution, including by: 
putting basic legal questions around crypto in a broader context,
explaining DeFi and DAOs through concepts and theories that regulators understand,
showing how money lego’s and decentralized networks can help lawmakers in their quest to break the stronghold of Big Tech and return control over our personal data to us, 
emphasizing that privacy and pseudonymity an opportunity rather than a threat.

With your help, CryptoLaw can educate lawmakers, regulators, policymakers… and the general public while we’re at it. This grant will be used for a variety of educational tools. We already have a few interviews on DeFi & regulatory aims (including with SEC Commissioner Peirce; and one with EU Commission Principal Economist Dr. Joachim Schwerin) and we want to add more. A Gitcoin grant will also help branch out to DAO topics, such as governance. We also want to contribute to crypto education and advocacy for our target audience of lawmakers through a series of explainer videos – for example, explaining the differences between counterparty risk in TradFi and AMMs, explaining how on-chain transparency can help achieve the aims of traditional disclosure rules, or explaining how DAOs offer a different way to pool resources to create value while mitigating agency costs.  

With your support, we can help stem the tide of legal FUD. There is still time to prevent a threatening wave of uninformed, restrictive rules. Let’s get going.",https://cryptolaw.substack.com/,22,22,726,1,1,https://github.com/cryptolawyers,1

Ethereum and GPU mining are actually what kickstarted my crypto journey, which is why ETH has always been a focus of mine. Since then Ethereum has changed A LOT, and so has VoskCoin.

Update #4 We continue to push forward with Ethereum education regardless of market conditions! Thanks to everyone who continues to support our Ethereum video education endeavor!

Update #3 thanks so much for the incredible support on here, it's exciting to know how many of you we have introduced to Gitcoin, I hope you all enjoyed the GTC airdrop, an incredible opportunity to be a part of this fanastic platform. Our goal is the same as ever, keep making the best Ethereum ecosystem video content we can in Gitcoin Grants Round 10!

Update #2 -- Did you know everyone who donated to our grants in Gitcoin grants round 8 received ~over 1 Ethereum worth of airdrops, that's insane! The donations did not have to be to our grants, simply any Gitcoin grants during that time period but it's really exciting that good actors are being heavily rewarded with valuable tokens!

UPDATE! VoskCoin is introducing ~1 million new potential investors and users to Ethereum each month with ETH centric video content on our YouTube channel, but don't just trust us -- you can verify yourself here!

VoskCoin is now my full-time focus and passion, along with several other awesome full-time and part-time team members. We are working on a lot of fun and exciting projects but the basic mission statement is to create fun and informative cryptocurrency content, that's free to view.

VoskCoin is now one of the largest and fastest cryptocurrency YouTube channels ever, with over 240,000 subscribers. In just the last month VoskCoin has received almost 3 million views and continues to gain ~1,000 new subscribers per day, and fortunately our statistics show no sign of slowing down. In addition to our YouTube channel we have our own cryptocurrency forum, VoskCoinTalk, which receives over 125,000 pageviews a month, as well as active Discord, Telegram, and Facebook communities with thousands of unique members in each server.

Here's our Gitcoin overview and review video! Thumbnails and titles styled this way are our best performers. I promise we keep it fun and informative in the actual video!

I'm here today with this grant to request not just funding, but also request the support of the Ethereum and Gitcoin community. By donating any Ethereum or ERC-20 token I can direct those funds to pay our team members to focus their time and skills on creating fun and informative content to help educate and onboard new users to the ETH ecosystem. All funding from this grant will be used to fund content creation on the VoskCoin platform to help grow the Ethereum ecosystem.

If you do not have funds you'd like to donate or simply don't want to, that's fine! I would actually appreciate you supporting our work by viewing our videos and subscribing the the channel more than anything else.

I know there are already some people and projects on here that have created great quality Ethereum and Decentralized Finance content, so why would you fund the VoskCoin Gitcoin grant? I think our biggest value proposition is our entire team are genuine fans, we do this full-time, and we are fortunate to have one the biggest platforms in the space!

Here's an example of VoskCoin covering Ethereum, this video revolves around Ethereum 2.0.

VoskCoin has launched another Gitcoin grant entirely focused on NFT Non-Fungible Tokens and creating a video series to teach new users what NFTs are, how to buy and sell them, as well as how to mint your own NFTs!

As I learn, I pass on that knowledge during livestreams, and the occasional drive to a fast-food drive-thru joint :)

My aim has been to dedicate the channel to developments happening across the ecosystem, with a firm foundation in Ethereum based content-- ETH is still my baby, and I hope to continue to share content to new audiences about it for as long as possible.

In software development, we define a vulnerability as:
""A weakness in the computational logic found in software that, when exploited, results in a negative impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Mitigation of the vulnerabilities in this context typically involves coding changes.""

There are a variety of tools and datasets available in the web 2.0 world about different library vulnerabilities. We aim to initiate the same thing for smart contracts. 

Smart Contract Vulnerability DB should become a place where every developer would check a smart contract before importing it. He will get all the necessary information regarding those contract vulnerabilities and what could be a solution for each one of them.

As we all know, the consequences of smart contracts Vulnerability could be enormous, and it's much more challenging (sometimes, even impossible) to upgrade smart contracts than a traditional application. That being said, such a tool would be beneficial for the whole community.

We can divide our engagement into two parts:

554,communitas,"commūnitās is targeting the lack of individually tackle economic, social and climate change issues. The platform will bring the community together in order to reach common goals by creating DAO’s to archive it.

Though blockchain template DAOs, communities could pool for a common interest, vote, propose new issues. Blockchain allows users to register goals, develop their collective policies, contract specifications, pool together -use of compound interest considered- and eventually, reach that goal of their project.

We want to create a replicable, from global to local DAO template framework in order to be able and facilitate the creation of multiple organizations where people come together to solve and improve sustainability problems in a wide range of areas, following the UN SDG. Some of the use cases & examples of commūnitās DAO's could be:

Ex1: MEET AND WELCOME PEOPLE (SDG11). Neighbours invest in purchasing a housing block on space permit. Since neighbours don’t own the property, they just pay for the use of the property during a determined period of time. Eventually, when they leave the property, they get their money back. All the terms & conditions are inside the created DAO.

Ex2: BUY BETTER STUFF (SDG12). BUY FAIRLY (SDG1). Directly link consumers and producers in a specific place (pool Km0 consumption), creating pick-up nodes in order to reduce the CO2 emissions impact, besides promoting local and seasonal ethical consumption.

Ex3: WORK WITH PURPOSE (SDG8). Pooling to stop speculation buying protected or environmental & culturally protected land.

Ex4: USE GREEN ENERGY (SDG7). A neighbouring community decides to invest in solar panels, posts the initiative on the blockchain platform. Neighbours pool together, so could do other users as an altruistic practice or in order to get equity risen by the compound interest.

Ex5: INVENT SMART SOLUTIONS (SDG9). The platform would facilitate the creation of public transport initiatives raisen by the users in order to improve the public network. Governments, companies and public/private associations could pool.

Ex6: JOIN GROUPS AND HAVE FUN (SDG17). LOVE ALL LIFE AND GET OUTDOORS (SDG15). Neighbors could promote a green space -like an orchard or urban vegetable paths in order to boost community, promote self-sufficient consumption and reduce CO2 while improving their leisure time.

Ex7: WASTE (SDG2). Work towards completing material cycles by creating recycling areas separated to collectively separate materials, organic waste, etc to use/sell it afterwards.

With our approach, we address the problem of lack of tools to build secure & trustworthy organizations that could, in a quick & easy way, solve local problems by gather together people with similar interests in a reliable way.

We are part of the SDG Hackathon, and we plan to keep the development of the commūnitās project starting with demo projects in our zone but also targeting other people to join & start building new DAOs around the world, where people could join, fund, archive a common goal and work together with a reliable binding contract deployed on the Blockchain & grow the project to become a new standard of project development, either for individuals, NGO's or communities.

4066,scribedao,"Problem
Crypto is dope. It's at the forefront of technology — solving some of the toughest problems with the widest implications.
Innovation happens a mile a minute. And the solution space has gone from core consensus and trading to new verticals like art, content, gaming, governance, coordination games — with implications that go beyond pure technology: public goods, political discourse, philosophical ramifications of our relationship with work and owning our own data, anthropological considerations with sub-community formations. (h/t 0xjim)

Solution 
We're forming a group that will alleviate this dual issue: too much content and not enough learners.
ScribeDAO will serve as a gathering point for
- Knowledge Seekers: who seek syntheses of information that they want to digest (e.g., articles, podcasts)
- Scribes: who want to dig deeper into crypto through these summary assignments (summarize content into bite-size chunks)  

This will all be beautifully presented in a digital Library of Alexandria.

Vision
Our vision is to be a learn-to-earn DAO that creates incentive structures for motivated Web3 community members to upskill themselves from readers of content, to synthesizers of content, and finally to creators of content. 

Progress 
In just a span of 3 months ScribeDAO has amassed 2.6k followers on Twitter and ~120 active participants. Our efforts are centered around creating good quality summaries and we consolidate the best summaries in a roundup called ""The Weekly Scroll"" (https://mataverse.substack.com/p/the-weekly-scroll-5). As an education hub we are quickly gaining views and status. 




But an even more valuable metric is that in just a few months since launch one of our members created a new opportunity for themselves and got a job! 



Future
Funding will be used for:
- Development of tools to streamline operations 
- ScribeDAO Library of Knowledge
- Creation of incentive structure (learn-2-earn economy)
- Develop resources to support continuation of high-quality content
- Branding collateral e.g. graphics, mockups etc

Support Us 
By supporting ScribeDAO, you are supporting the generation of a public good: synthesized knowledge for all. We want to improve our operational structures and help create positive incentives for participants to continue generating high quality and relevant content.

288,educational-deeply-technical-talks-help-me-buy-a-,"Hi all,

Over the years, I have tried to contribute towards education and technical deep-dives for Ethereum. 

My motivation to help with education has always to 1) remove misconceptions that sprawl up due to marketing and unachievable expectations and 2) to give back to a community that has taught me so much (from irc channels, mailing lists, telegram groups, god forbid even CT). 

I volunteer once a month to teach a weekend developer bootcamp in London, I travel to conferences to teach technical content and also offered a free 10-week cryptocurrency course (links below). 

I really enjoy teaching and giving back to the community, but one obstacle I always run into is that it is really hard to get a good recording of the talk so I can put it up on youtube!

I always rely on others to record, edit and post the video. Sometimes this works out really well, and other times not so great. 

So I am hoping for some small donations here to help me towards purchasing:

A ""starter"" DLSR camera
https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B079Y45KTJ/ref=dp_cerb_1
A lavalier recorder:

By the way, I 100% appreciate recommendations for more cost-effective cameras or recorders. 

To keep it short; the purpose of the grant is to help me purchase equipment so I can publish better quality educational material and become less reliant on others to do it for me! I think this is useful marketing to help get more developers in the space (towards >1m developers in 2020). 

p.s. I promise to perform a live podcast/technical interview via hot-tub if we hit the target

DEXTF is a protocol to connect peer to peer Investors and Portfolio Managers. It enables digital-native funds where two parties - which are mutually distrusting - can cryptographically verify the status of the funds and enforce their rights directly through a digital wallet.

DEXTF protocol enables the creation of Structured Tokens which are hybrid tokens that combine the features of multiple different DeFi projects: yields, derivatives, synthetics, options, etc. This enables DEXST creators to adjust the risk-return profile of investments, vastly expanding the number of possible payoffs.

GLOBAL GOVERNMENT - GLOBAL DIGITAL JURISDICTION


DEMOCRACY DIDN'T GET AN UPDATE IN A LONG TIME

WE HAVE TO REBUILD TRUST

New models of trust and governance

Architecting the new world


We believe in digital. We believe that exponential technologies will give us the tools to heal the planet after this Crisis and to give power to people to lead the world together.


It's accelerated moment in history, everything is going exponential through technology. Rapid innovations, change, new inventions....


We are in social system, we are in capitalism.

We seems stuck in forms, in our political forms.

WE NEED NEW LAW.

OPEN SOURCE ALLOW EVERYONE TO BECOME LAW-MAKER

CODE IS LAW


We need to invent a better political economy for the new era of DIGITAL ECONOMY.

The role of government is quite simple: direct human activity and it may have been the best tool in the past. BUT...that is no longer the case.

Blockchain can provide us with a better alternative to direct society at large.

Blockchain systems are open source. Meaning that anyone can read the code & see the rules for themselves. This means NONE can game the system, discriminate against minorities, or cheat, or evade paying taxes.

The whole point is we use it because we want to, not because the government demand us to.

CODE IS LAW - LET'S START





Appendix:

People are asking: Why do I have to vote if everything's the same? They don't believe in real change.

For instance: I am an entrepreneur, I have to incorporate my company, I have my company incorporated in the UK, now I am in SF, to receive funds from investors here I have to incorporate my company in the US. I am from Argentina, I also pay my taxes there. So, where do I have to pay taxes? In the UK, In the US, In Argentina. I also have my E-residence in Estonia, I have my NGO there. Does NGO have to pay taxes?

Entrepreneurs in the US are asking: How can I receive investment from CHINA, RUSIA, BOLIVIA? Not allowed in the US.

Other Ask: How can we receive support from governments? When I am talking about changing the world together, Govs & Companies, everyone say to me, ""forget it. Its bureaucracy, everything is arranged in advance, you can not do anything with them.""

Another example: I was opening my FTX account: I was in US jurisdiction. My chip of my cellphone is from Argentina. I also have another chip from the UK, because my company is there and I was living there. I also have another chip in the US because I am living here now. I was trying to open my account from the US. The US is not allowed to open FTX here, so I downloaded VPN. To change the jurisdiction, I have to change the chip in my cellphone to get the SMS double-check corresponding with the jurisdiction I was opening the account.

Changing 3 chips in my cellphone, changing 3 jurisdictions to open the account, one country, another country, one phone, another phone. So. I realized we need a Global Digital Jurisdiction. Global citizens, Global Services, 5G. Starlink.

Other day: One friend asked me, I love your project about taxation, but how are you thinking to avoid double taxation?

Answer: GLOBAL GOVERNMENT - GLOBAL DIGITAL JURISDICTION - GLOBAL TAX

Coinosis is a decentralized, participatory education platform that facilitates study circles on topics of interest to the crypto community. We are going to experiment with IRL events to build a community of contributors for Devcon in Bogotá.

🤖 Our dApp provides a space for collaborative learning. By using smart contracts that store individual contributions on xDAI. These funds are distributed proportionally according to the recognition of the participants.

How does it work?
Stake crypto to join, earn by sharing your knowledge Each participant has to make a deposit to join the conversation. A smart contract manages the funds in a secure, decentralized fashion.

💸 You can pay using fiat. Send crypto directly to the smart contract. 

We want more people to learn collaboratively, to keep that desire alive with a group of people with common interests. We help each other when the subject becomes difficult.



The knowledge you provide is rewarded with crypto

👏🏼Your received claps correspond to the proportional distribution of the contract’s funds.

1️⃣. If you ended up with more crypto, it means that others learned from you.

2️⃣. If you ended up with less crypto, it means that you learned from others.

We are building a web agency owned by it's ""team"" (workers in the Agency) & ""clients"" (other DAO's or ""traditional clients"". 

The idea is an experiment in bootstrapping and running something like a traditional web agency (SEO, Web Dev, Marketing etc). 

We can work on projects inside and outside of cryptospace but we should aim to only take clients that are willing to participate in the DAO (we will have some methods to allow them to hold AC tokens). 

Traditional clients should be willing to incorporate some DEFI strategies into their projects. 

Our goal is to build a massive decentralised Agency that is also capable of doing its own ventures which should be based on open source projects (not limited to crypto space but always incorporating crypto methodologies & systems. Think mashing up open source repos with Defi systems ;)

We have listed some example ventures as a guide on our website.

We need the money to reach the last mile of our development
want to hear more? 

Our goal is to give people who live in today’s inefficient economies a platform for creation of new standards for financial collaboration and value exchange that are tailor-made to suit unique local  commons and are a perfect fit for local community’s values, and way of life.

Our app will empower everyday people to set up local currencies in minutes with seamless UX, manage and grow their community’s internal micro-economy using blockchain technology as if it was everyday banking  except they built and own the bank - completely independent from day one

We have a wide variety of communities from all over the world from the Caribbean to Australia that is already taking part in our project
The Seedbed economic incentive model resembles the concept of “Proof of Stake” consensus mechanism (POS): participants are rewarded for saving money and making contributions to the community pool which in turn can be used for loans and joint business ventures, while the savings bonuses grow the economy and can be used for transactions in trade between community members.
We have completed the smart contract foundation of the Seedbed platform and are now working on our native app front end APIs. Proceeds of this grant will help us accomplish this important milestone

2805,the-tor-project,"The Tor Project is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Our mission is to advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting their unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding.

We develop free and open source software for privacy and freedom online, protecting people from tracking, surveillance, and censorship--the Tor network and Tor Browser.

Supporting the Tor Project
As a nonprofit, donations help the Tor Project stay agile in the face of increasing censorship and surveillance online. Your contributions in 2022 will help us to:

(1) Improve the Tor network: We will continue to work on Arti so that Tor is on the right path for the future, and we will simultaneously continue to make improvements to the current Tor daemon code. Our congestion control project will make a big improvement in user experience on the Tor network and we want you to benefit from it right away. We already knew that the speed of page loads and downloads are big issues for our users, and our recent usability survey confirmed that. You’ve made it clear that it’s important for us to address speed on the network and by this time in 2022, we have high hopes that you will experience improvements.

(2) Fight censorship against Tor: As we write this, our team and our community is dealing with new censorship attacks from Russia. When a user is facing censorship against the Tor network, it can be difficult for them to understand why they can’t connect and how exactly to change their Tor Browser configuration to circumvent this censorship. Our Anti-Censorship, UX, and Application teams have been working on this problem for a long time, and in 2022, we will ship a completely new experience that will automate the censorship detection and circumvention process, simplifying connecting to Tor for users who need it the most.

(3) Improve Tor on mobile: In 2022 we will also begin the work to provide a better experience for users on mobile, starting with the Android platform, the most used mobile operating system in the world. We know that the user experience of Tor Browser for Android is different from Tor Browser for desktop. Many of the services you use in a browser on desktop (by visiting their website) have become a stand-alone app on mobile. We are doing research to better understand users' needs in this environment and will begin to design a Tor app for Android that will help you route your app connections through Tor, a ‘VPN-like’ app. This way, we can offer the robust protection of an encrypted and decentralized network like Tor for a wider variety of use cases.

(4) Focus on the health of the Tor network: The success of all of the above depends on ensuring that the Tor network is healthy. Last year, our team  improved existing and created new tools that help us monitor the Tor network for malicious relay activity so that we can remove them from the network. In 2022, we will continue to improve these tools and we will work on automating some of the steps in this process so that we can take faster actions to protect the network. We will also roll out a series of initiatives to better organize our relay operator community and strengthen the relationship and trust between the Tor Project and the relay operators. This way our network, which is 100% based on volunteer (community) support, can grow and stay safe.

These are just some of our goals for this year. You can read more about our other plans, including continuing our user-first development, expanding mobile support, and investigating token implementations on our blog: https://blog.torproject.org/tor-in-2022/

4197,basindao-unlocking-carbon-natural-capital-value-i,"Looking to be part of a climate solution that is repeatable, deployable and scalable?

BASIN uses web3 to do land restoration, regeneration and conservation at scale by unlocking carbon and natural capital in real estate.

The $BASIN platform facilitates the acquisition and stewardship of undervalued / degraded property and regenerates it for economic and environmental benefit at scale.



Basin works at the inspection of climate risk, carbon removal and the nature crisis to create climate resilience and absolute returns.

Message us or TMO (tmoindustries) for the full BASIN Field Guide.  It covers basinDAO, basinTrust and basinFoundation and the ReFi mechanism that enables the $BASIN platform.

Climate Adaptation: Every $1 spent on climate adaptation and resilience reaps $4 to $9 in benefits.

Carbon Markets: The voluntary carbon market grew 60% to $1B last year and is projected to grow 100x by 2050. Every tonne of GHG removal delivers $664 in additional economic, social & environmental co-benefits.

Natural Capital: The value of nature? ~$8 quadrillion That’s not a typo. This is the value of the benefits nature provides people.

The systems and institutions that got us into this mess will not get us out. The investments relied on by previous generations will soon produce negative returns. ""Carbon tunnel vision"" neglects the interconnectedness of the climate-biodiversity-social problem.

Underneath all is the Land. Regardless of what you call it: Real Estate. Real Property. Real Assets. Property is the the largest global market in existence: over $350T. Basin uses the “bundle of rights” embedded in real estate to restore, regenerate and conserve land at scale.

Natural capital is our collective stock of natural assets that makes life possible. It provides the air we breathe, the water we drink, the soil we cultivate and the biodiversity that sustains life. Carbon is just a co-benefit of thriving ecosystems.

The $BASIN formula works in all ecosystems with a focus on Nature Based Solutions (NBS).



The new nature economy will generate $10T of value annually and will create 395 million jobs by 2030. Separately, sucking carbon from the air is predicted to be a trillion dollar business by 2050.

BASIN will be a major part of this. We would love for you to be a part of it also!

1518,mindful-portfolio-alignment-for-degens,"Ever told yourself you'll take profits but waited far too long? Ever sold the bottom and then bought back higher? 

Ever FOMOed into an asset at the top after it went 10x? 

We have - so we're building Mindful to avoid these traps.

About:

Mindful was built out of a need. As DeFi natives, we wanted to learn from our mistakes, and calm our degenerate tendencies. So, for ETHOnline, we decided to build something we'd actually use - and after the competition, it became apparent that others wanted to use it too.

With this new platform, you can create auto rebalancing portfolios known as Chakras, adopt strategies to mindfully DCA into assets, and take profits automatically. Set your own strategy, or follow a guru.

Mindful's intuitive UI guides users seamlessly through the Chakra creation and strategy-setting process. Built on Ethereum, it works with all major wallets and ERC20 assets.

With Mindful, we hope to enable other crypto traders to invest mindfully, take the emotion out of trading, and actually realize profits instead of riding gains back down to the bottom.

Start aligning your chakras today.

Roadmap:

We're a small team working on a number of other projects. Our current target is to release the first version of Mindful on mainnet towards the end of November / early December 2020. 

This version will include:

Chakra creation
DCA strategies
Profit-taking strategies

We have a lot of plans for Mindful in the future. We're seeking funding to help support us in our efforts to bring these to fruition.

The aim of the Institute of Cryptoanarchy is to make available tools for unlimited dissemination of information on the Internet and encouraging a parallel decentralized economy, crypto-currencies and other conditions for the development of a free society in the 21st century.

The main motive for us is the belief that censorship is not a phenomenon only in “the distant dictatorial world”.
States and their security agencies globally control access to information and use the protection of intellectual property as an excuse to apply total censorship to control the available resources.
The State on a global level processes private mail and personal data, even though the European Court of Justice decided on the illegitimacy of “data retention”.
The State and corporations have data on economic behavior, and through legislation they have received complete access to all payment transactions and consumer habits.
New technology brings the possibility of choice – we are in a time that is defined by The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto.

Our vision is to create a more equitable world where people are rewarded according to the impact of their work, not according to their status, via making rewarding labor as nuanced as human contribution often is. As a DAO we are committed to being one piece in the puzzle of a healthier future where systems serve community members, where financial maximization isn’t the end-all be-all goal, and where wealth flows to those who are creating value in our world.

SourceCred has had a year full of transformational challenges in our organizational structure, and we are working holistically to recover amongst those structural and relational changes. 
 
In light of these challenges, and SourceCred’s goal of creating technology via which organizations can economically and culturally support the relational nuances of equitable labor, this grant ask is focused towards receiving financial support for the ongoing improvement of our restorative processes for navigating and rewarding the often invisible social fabric level work, including: relational labor, internal mentorship, trust building, care work, conflict mediation, history/narrative keeping, and overall ‘culture building’ within SourceCred. 
 
We’ve had successes so far in the areas above via building practices of consensus, refining our code of conduct, deepening our documentation and practice of our values, curating groups that focus on celebrating and supporting specific identity groups within SourceCred (e.g. Queer AsFuck & Men’s groups), created a non-verbal communication system to streamline connection within town halls/group collaborations, and continuing to work to be inclusive and self organizing. 
 
As an organization SourceCred is committed to our ongoing growth, especially through this transformational year, and thus the current focuses for this grant support, include strengthening our efforts in the following areas: 
conflict management/mediation
decentralization & strengthening governance infrastructure 
values documentation/integration
marcomms (including efforts toward our upcoming token launch)
 
Humans are at the center of what makes SourceCred great. We believe that building a resilient and attuned culture allows us to tackle the important undertakings SourceCred’s technology itself is designed to address. 
 
Thank you so much for choosing to support SourceCred!

 What is The Defiant?
Hello, the DeFi world adepts! Decentralized community is expanding permanently but the flood of information nowadays can mislead both newcomers and digital geeks. That is why The Defiant media is covering all the important shifts, news, and events along with educational materials and analytical articles on the verge of tech and financial markets. It’s the only content platform producing unbiased, objective journalism, that’s focused on decentralized finance.
Moreover, The Defiant contributors provide all the information in easy-to-read weekly newsletters and digests. You can get the whole week recap in one mail. Also, subscribers can find more peculiar info in podcasts, YouTube channel, and website.
 Why The Defiant in Russian?
The project is going right now through a massive expansion to the global markets and is featured in other languages e.g. Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, French, etc.
People from CIS countries like Russia, Belorussia, or Ukraine are very active in the decentralized world but still, these communities are poorly organized and have almost no access to the high-quality information focused on the DeFi. The local news channels produce too much news, paid press releases and simple articles with no value to the community. Such informational sources are rather harmful and waste the time of readers.
The Defiant has its own standards and values on spreading information, educating and informing people. It is the new way to digest the news agenda and to stay tuned in an engaging, quick and funny way.
The Defiant Ru is using these principles to build a sustainable Russian-speaking community of educated and informed people who share DeFi world values.
 Our Gitcoin goals
The Defiant Russian is not just one person. It is a team of translators and editors which volunteers to bring all THe Defiant agenda to Russian-speaking subscribers. But to keep the quality high and everyone motivated we need to compensate all the efforts. Also, we need to bring more experienced translators and authors for the contribution.
It would take approximately $/month to sustain publishing for The Defiant Ru readers.

With all of the traditional versions of the Bible, “Our Bible” preserves the KJV Bible on the Ethereum blockchain one verse at a time. 
The word of God faces threats from an ever-growing list of Bible versions as well. Bible versions besides KJV purport to improve readability, while in actuality they change the meaning of verses and outright remove them.
Thanks to the immutable nature of Ethereum's blockchain, we have an opportunity to preserve the Bible. Together, we can add one verse at a time to the blockchain so it may be retrieved in a distributed way.
We can work together to maintain the word of God — free from the tampering of those who would seek its diminishment through adulteration.

How it works:
This Dapp interacts with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain to add verses from the Bible to the blockchain.
That smart contract includes an oracle that pulls KJV Bible verses from the Our Bible API. Once the oracle retrieves a verse, it sends the verse back to the smart contract where the verse is preserved on the blockchain.

All of Our Bible is open source! Take a look and contribute to the site, API and smart contract.

Help us develop this project by donating a little amount to this GRANT or on our website. The funds received will be used to add more features to the site.

2924,helping-drive-the-refi-movement-and-putting-the-p,"Joseph Pallant and the Blockchain for Climate Foundation team are grateful for the opportunity to steward an on-chain future for carbon markets. A familiar face in ReFi, we're here to support success by bridging traditional carbon market expertise into the logic of crypto-carbon endeavour. From explaining the ins and outs of climate impact of blockchain in the news, to duking it out with ReFi naysayers in print, to repping for maximum effective crypto-carbon degeneracy to the traditional carbon market, we go hard for the vision of crypto as an integral contributor to the defeat of climate change. Our organizational focus of the last half decade has been to build the BITMO Platform, enabling national governments to issue and exchange Paris Agreement carbon credits as ERC1155 NFTs. More recently, we're working to enable additional, pre-Paris carbon markets to join the ReFi movement and get their offsets on Polygon.

Why Gitcoin Grants?
We are seeking your continued generosity to support our non-profit work to bring carbon offsets on-chain. This work takes the form of broad ReFi engagement and advocacy, as well as our current work to operate & engage national government users of the BITMO Platform.

What is the BITMO Platform?
Launched at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, the BITMO Platform is an innovative public good that enables signatories to the Paris Agreement to issue and exchange carbon credits as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) known as ""Blockchain Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes"" (BITMOs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Each BITMO – equivalent to one tonne of CO2 mitigated – has all pertinent carbon credit data embedded into the NFT and is settled immediately when exchanged, integral to creating  efficient and progressively more decentralized carbon market. 

Our goal with the BITMO Platfom is to help solve global coordination failure on climate action by connecting -capital- and -demand- for emissions reductions, with the best climate action -opportunities- around the world. With countries finally agreeing on the broad rules for an international Paris Agreement carbon market, the BITMO Platform stands by to enable a quick start to international carbon trading under Paris Agreement Article 6. The BITMO Platform provides the accounting and exchange infrastructure necessary and serve as a secure record of the issuance, transfer, and retirement for each country's carbon credits under the Paris Agreement – i.e., Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) – that are then reconciled with National Carbon Registries.

BITMOs are deployed as ERC-1155 NFTs on Ethereum, which enable a straightforward and transparent exchange of specific carbon projects – a fit for the traditional carbon market – but can also be pooled, bridged to Polygon and integrated into ReFi protocols like KlimaDAO and others. We’ve built the original BITMO Platform on Ethereum because, along with its L2s, it has provided the best inspiration, functionality, and interoperable ""green money legos"" needed to deliver our mission.

Who is Blockchain for Climate Foundation?
Blockchain for Climate Foundation was established in 2017 to advance Paris Agreement Article 6 and shepherd an effective, efficient, and timely global carbon market using blockchain technology. Today, we are proud to draw on our experience to provide a portfolio of services at the convergence of blockchain and climate, to support broader engagements in the community, including those focused on the tokenization of carbon, climate impact of NFTs, and regenerative finance (ReFi). Importantly, our expanded scope of work includes forking the BITMO Platform onto Polygon so non- and pre-Paris Agreement offset programs have a pathway for tokenizing their offsets. This also gives us excellent opportunity to engage with national governments around compelling environmental use cases for blockchain.

For more information:
Thank you so much for your interest in Blockchain for Climate Foundation!

656,international-medical-corps,"Our Response
Working with the WHO, International Medical Corps is leveraging its relationships with local and national ministries of health globally to provide expertise, equipment, training, and triage and treatment services. International Medical Corps has designed a multi-pronged approach to ensure that at-risk countries and regions are able to prepare for and respond to potential outbreaks of coronavirus. Our priority response activities include:

Training and Capacity Building
Capacity building for health workers in at-risk countries is critical to slow and address the spread of the coronavirus. The countries most at-risk for deadly potential outbreaks are those with limited health infrastructure and capacity to meet the needs of this rapidly spreading disease—such as the Philippines, Iraq, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Ethiopia.
To meet the most critical gaps of each at-risk country, International Medical Corps will 1) determine the highest risk factors to contracting the disease based on the specific context; 2) deliver infection prevention and control (IPC) training modified to that local context; 3) target health facility staff as training recipients, helping to keep health workers safe and health facilities operational; and 4) incorporate a “training of trainers” approach that will equip select health workers to train others, exponentially increasing the number of people equipped to respond to the outbreak.

Prepositioning and Deploying Medicines and Supplies
With a global shortage of personal protective equipment—specifically N95 masks—this support is critical, as the costs of these supplies are rising exponentially. Before the outbreak, one N95 mask cost approximately $0.50. Today, one mask is as much as $22.00. The shortage and rising costs of supplies are not only affecting the coronavirus response, but are also limiting the availability of supplies to fight other diseases, such as Ebola in the DRC. Moreover, there is a rising concern for the supply of medications, as some countries implement restrictions on exports of pharmaceuticals.

International Medical Corps will leverage its longstanding collaboration with FedEx and its global supply-chain network to procure and deploy the medicines, medical supplies and equipment that health facilities and frontline health workers need. Supplies will include face masks, gloves, goggles and gowns—critical as personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers—among other items.

Deployment of Screening and Triage Stations, and Case Management
When the situation demands, International Medical Corps will directly support the implementation of IPC measures in at-risk health facilities and refugee camps throughout the 30 countries where we work. Building on the screening and referral unit (SRU) model developed in the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak—a model called “near perfect” by the CDC—International Medical Corps’ Emergency Response Team will deploy Coronavirus Advanced Medical Posts (CAMPs). These screening and triage centers at health facilities, transit hubs, hospitals, or at entry points of refugee and IDP camps, will help with screening and isolation of individuals with at-risk symptoms. Key features of International Medical Corps’ screening and triage centers include:
Triage Point: for screening and identification of patients with Coronavirus symptoms
Health Post: for consultation and stabilization of severe cases
Dispatch Post: for ambulances to transfer patients in need of hospitalization
Healthcare Waste Management Zone: for safe storage and safe disposal of medical waste
As the outbreak spreads, International Medical Corps will also provide case management support for testing for, and treatment of, coronavirus.

Community Outreach and Engagement
The emergence of coronavirus already is resulting in the distribution of misinformation and instances of stigma, which can contribute to additional health concerns, because they may lead individuals to hide their illness and avoid seeking healthcare immediately, discouraging healthy behaviors. Community outreach and engagement are critical not only to address stigma of the disease, but also to encourage proper health-seeking behavior.
International Medical Corps’ community outreach messaging includes information on proper hygiene practices to prevent the spread of coronavirus, as well as encouraging community surveillance, and supporting referral options for individuals with symptoms, enabling them to seek healthcare quickly. International Medical Corps also is prepared to address longer-term mental health and psychosocial support needs.

Epidemic Response Team
International Medical Corps maintains an Epidemic Response Team comprising clinicians, logisticians and sanitation experts on standby for the World Health Organization (WHO) and ready to deploy when requested. This team includes former CDC epidemiologists and public health experts who have worked throughout the international NGO and governmental spectrum, and who have experience working on outbreaks of infectious disease, including SARS, MERS, H1N1, flu and Ebola. The team remains flexible and ready to deploy globally to provide surged medical support in health facilities, hospitals and communities to address the spread of coronavirus, in coordination with the WHO and local ministries of health.

1134,organicblock-redefining-urban-farming,"The Organic-Block is a decentralized urban agricultural platform where people could rent vacant spaces such as backyards, rooftops or basements to produce crops using vertical farming methods. Our application incentives the urban population to farm by giving them a designated marketplace to sell their new product to consumers in their areas. We also provide our low-cost modern IoT equipment and service for vertical farming techniques.

 We are very focused on the impact factor and our product meets the following UN Development Goals:

UN Sustainable Development Goals
Goal 2: End Hunger
Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities
Goal 15: Reduction in forest loss and land degradation
Goal 13: Climate Action
Goal 12: Sustainable production pattern

Blockchain technology improves the following areas within the agricultural sector:
 
 
1.      Optimization of the Food Supply Chain – Reducing the time of food origin tracing to a matter of seconds — ensuring safety and improving efficiency.
2.      Crop Insurance – Communicates loads, geo way-points and basic compliance information with carriers and registers the quality of the product, its price, location, and parties involved.
3.      Transaction – Helps farmers to sell commodities at fair prices and lowering transaction fees thereby supporting smaller farmers to enter the market.
4.      Traceability – Smart contracts insure a farmer’s crops and claim damages thus replacing old and burdensome insurance processes, which could take up to months.


We analyzed a lot of issues regarding renting guidelines and also the authenticity of crops. As the crops in the market place are grown through our platform, this can ensure the authenticity of every product with the help of the underlying Blockchain Architecture. Also, crypto-based payments can potentially give profits for both parties. Our project is an android application and the web interface is made of Vue.js. We have built our Blockchain Architecture over Fortmatics Plasma Framework. The documentation is encrypted by using the Blockstack Encryption framework. This was primarily to scale our applications for the Indian markets and traffic. We also integrated crypto-based payments from Metamask.

Features
1.     A peer-to-peer infrastructure which connects owner to the renter.
2.     A fully decentralized architecture backed by our Blockchain Network.
3.     An inbuilt market place to incentivize the urban population into farming.
4.     Authenticity reassured using our public Blockchain Network.

Our Vision
The vision of Organic Block is to incorporate technologies such as the automated artificial environment for plant growth. This can give a complete analysis of the farm conditions to the owner and buyer. Also improving the IoT hardware to make it comparable with multiple types of lands and climate. We plan to start a venture by designing our prototype into an end product with a much better and interactive UI, app under-development.

Our Accomplishment
We have made an end to end functional application for the project and also a web interface. We also integrated the crypto payments mechanism and we used IPFS for our decentralized storage mechanism.

563,smart-contracts-for-non-blockchain-developers,"To further blockchain's expansion I will create a series of smart contracts that will enable developers with limited blockchain experience to create fully functioning Ethereum based dapps without having to learn a new language.

The result of this proposal will allow developers that have had success building apps in other languages to extend that success creating dapps without being hindered by having to learn a new language. In essence, solidity could be treated as an API that can be easily customized by the developer in the language of their choice.

Coming from a background of app development I want to make a series of ""helper/utility contracts"" built on the Ethereum blockchain that compensate for the main pain points I had when learning dapp development.

The contracts would allow developers coming from other languages to define a set of parameters that would be returned when the contract successfully saved to the blockchain.

Taking CryptoZombies (what I hope many people are familiar with) as an example, when javascript requests `result.dna` the expectation is for a number up to 16 digits in length that is influenced by a submitted string.

Currently, the developer would have to code the request in javascript, then code the logic that returns the digits in solidity, then handle the result in javascript. With the proposed contracts the developer will be able to code solely in javascript and still receive dynamic information from solidity.

With the proposed contracts in place a request to return an integer between 3 and 16 digits in length would look something along the lines of:
```
const customValues = {
 zombieDNA:{int,3,16}
}
SolidityUtil.create(customValues)
// ... more javascript code

console.log(zombieDNA) // 1374693525379
//rerun the code
console.log(zombieDNA) // 64836957467
```

To add seeded information to the request is a simple extension of the base code:
```
const seedValues = {
 zombieDNA: [""Custom Zombie Name""]
}
const customValues = {
 zombieDNA:{int,3,16}
}
SolidityUtil.create(customValues,seedValues)
// ... more javascript code

console.log(zombieDNA) // 53749254903
//rerun the code
console.log(zombieDNA) // 53749254903
```

Behind the scenes of the above method the contract would have access to everything solidity consists of. Allowing for integrations with all transaction hashes as they are created and needed. The hashes and results of these transactions will then be able to be applied to the next step in a chain function.

I have started in on the basic implementation and hope to have this grant funded to fully incorporate the basic features (expanded below) and introduce complex features that would allow chaining of the basics and allow developers of all backgrounds to create dapps within the blockchain ecosystem and grow the culture profusely.

Any additional time and/or funding would be used to create IDE autofills and error checks, as well as a GUI (most likely in the form of a chrome extension) to allow basic definitions and complex chain variables to be visualized and tested before being exported into the finalized code to be integrated (javascript/ios/java/etc).

Update: Since creating this grant we have started a series of crowdplayed streams and published the Primitives and Lore at the center of Moving Castles. We also have set up the MVP infrastructure as described below and started to populate a Community Wiki. 

Funds generated through this grant will be used to support the existing work and support the development of an open source toolkit to be used by other communities.

----

In a collaboration with Trust, we will in early 2022 launch Portal Arc: a series of three reoccurring stream formats that explore world-building, knowledge games, governance games and cross-community gameplay using Discord, Metamask/WalletConnect and Twitch integrations with Unreal engine. For this first MVP (see diagram here) we will establish the core primitive functions of Moving Castles towards our vision of a federated metaverse (see diagram here).

Moving Castles is developed according to the following principles:
Collective: Many contributors share control through transparent and real-time governance mechanisms.
Portable: To avoid lock-in mechanisms, Moving Castles have the ability to move freely between platforms, standards and protocols.
Modular: Communities should have the ability to construct Moving Castles by creating, importing, and arranging composable parts (such as avatars, props and environments) together as a coherent whole while making these parts available for others to reuse and adapt.
Interoperable: They have the ability to interact with other communities; communicating, playing games, and sharing knowledge & skills in order to help these communities become Moving Castles themselves.

Our initial prototype will feature:
3 games produced using Unreal Engine and controlled by Discord & Twitch users, testing key functions of the Moving Castles thesis.
Identity layer for off-chain inventory (items, votes), onchain assets (Tokens, NFTs) and Unreal access control connecting Metamask, WalletConnect, Twitch & Discord
Three inventory primitives: community scale, group scale and individual agent scale, and their avatar representations.

We will collaborate with 5 3D artists and 3 additional developers for this first MVP. You can find our initial post on Moving Castles on the Gitcoin blog, and an extended version here. Moving Castles was a recipient of the Gitcoin Public Goods RFP.

Incentives are aligned accordingly, proposing the introduction of NAVI Token, that can be earned only by delivering a shared order, or in the form of interest, by partaking in liquidity mining activities.

- providing multiple crowdsourced smaller prizes for specific, relevant scientific longevity challenges, but that are also possible to achieve within ~1-3 years. 
- we would invite longevity scientist and enthusiasts to join as a jury to help define/refine different prizes, and upvote those they find most relevant

We have an open channel within VitaDAOs discord where you can get involved to propose specific prizes or researchers that would be worthy of retroactive prizes.

This model is inspired by Methusaleh Mouse Prize, and we are also planning to team up with them on, to seek input from them, as well as try to win them over joining the prize.

4052,defor-defi-aggregator-that-everyone-can-participa,"Defor can indeed complete transfer, swap, financial management, and secured transaction functions without having ETH in the account, and will support more high-quality DeFi projects in the future. At present, there is no way for transactions on Ethereum to be completely gas-free. There is a role called solver in Defor, which mainly helps users send transactions and pay gas fee at the same time, so that users do not have to pay it.

The Crypto World is in Full Swing. But Wait, is Everything Okay?
As all crypto people would like to see, the crypto world is thriving — DeFi broke out in 2020 and NFT was launched in 2021.

The number of wallet addresses has already exceeded 100 million, among which about 3 million addresses have participated in DeFi (as of October 2021).

All projects are pursuing TVL(Total Value Locked), No one cares about users — especially the requirements of regular users. Is that okay?

Roughly speaking, crypto users are divided into two categories: senior users and regular users.

Senior users are familiar with crypto products and are proficient in financial rules. They choose to use a wealth of tools: use Compound, Aave, and Maker to borrow; use Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Curve for asset swap; use Dydx, Perpetual and Hegic to trade futures and options; use Nexus Mutual and InsurAce to hedge risks… etc. They can capture value, control risk, seize opportunities, and maximize the yield. At the same time, they are proficient in using various wallets (such as metamask, ledger…) and exchanges (such as coinbase, binance…) to keep their assets.

Regular users are much more “easy” than senior users, using metamask for transfers, and a single DEX (such as Uniswap, Sushiswap) for token swap.

Oh…don’t forget that there are still a large number of users who only use centralized exchanges.

By the way, with the removal of centralized exchanges by some heavily regulated countries, a large number of users will no longer be able to participate in crypto activities.

Defor — Everything Revolves Around the User
Without ETH
All operations on Defor do not need to hold gas token (such as ETH, BNB).

Most users are quite embarrassed when they run out of ETH in their wallet:
1. Purchase digital assets with fiat currency on OTC
2. Recharge in a centralized exchange
3. Swap ETH on a centralized exchange
4. Withdraw ETH from the centralized exchange to the wallet

Don’t talk about the trouble, the handling fee will consume a lot back and forth.

Using Defor can avoid the above troubles, you can choose to send transaction tokens as the fee, everything will become more convenient.

Innovation, Enhancement and Optimization
Defor creatively enhances and optimizes functions, so that users can get an extremely smooth experience.

For example, users can attach the functions of scheduled transmission (specify the sending time of this transaction) and password confirmation (send this transaction after the recipient uses the password to make confirmation) when transferring money.

Simplify the Protocol
Defor packages, integrates and simplifies various complex protocols, and users don’t need to care about which protocol is used by the underlying layer.

For example, users don’t need to care about whether the underlying layer uses uniswap, sushiswap or something else when using swap, Defor simplifies all of these.

Super Scalability
Great gameplay and good products in the crypto world emerge in endlessly. Defor can extend and integrate at any time as long as it is useful to users.

Vision
As a one-stop portal, Defor is committed to breaking down the barriers of crypto world so as to make users access in safe, convenient and no-threshold way.

What is Swivel?

Since ETHDenver 2020 we have been building out Swivel, the decentralized protocol for fixed-rate lending and interest-rate derivatives.

For our initial release, Swivel v1 will facilitate trustless interest-rate swaps, allowing cautious lenders to lock in a guaranteed yield, and speculators to leverage their rate exposure, placing Swivel in a unique spot within the market.

While we have been hearing demand for fixed-rate lending for some time, and we expect that fixed lending demand will continue to grow, at Swivel we feel that rate hedging and speculation will be the impetus for industry expansion. That said, as the practical source for both fixed-rates and significant rate exposure, we expect that those looking to hedge borrowed positions or speculate on rates will be especially exited to take advantage of the opportunity that Swivel v1 introduces to the Ethereum ecosystem.

We're currently live at https://swivel.exchange with markets built on top of Rari and Compound!


Our Story:

In the days before the world stopped leaving their homes, my co-founder William Hsieh and I started working on Swivel, then DefiHedge, at ETHDenver2020. We left ETHDenver with a ton of initial momentum, finished our basic on-chain proof-of-concept and, with some potential investor encouragement, then began working full time on Swivel.

Coming off that push and looking for an opportunity to legitimize the project, we then joined Gitcoin’s Kernel Fellowship Genesis cohort, an experience that has been integral to getting where we are today. Kernel of course accelerated our development, but more importantly introduced us to a community of developers and thought leaders that have been invaluable. Between contributions to our liquidity incentive design from Status’ Andy Tudhope and continuous input from Kernel mentor and now Swivel contibutor Thomas Klocanas, we came out of Kernel with a novel protocol design and the guidance we needed. 

We have a large debt to Gitcoin, ETHGlobal, and the broader community, and hope to pay it forward throughout this round and all following Gitcoin grant rounds !

Introduction 
Climate change is a fact, and it is widely acknowledged that the world is in the midst of a global warming crisis. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion and land use change have released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which is the primary driver of recent climate change. Land use such as agriculture alone, discharges more than 6 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere each year. Because of the increased severity of climate change impacts in some areas, the consequences have been more severe and disastrous.


In Uganda, Climate change is a serious problem, affecting livelihoods. The country experiences prolonged drought, short and erratic rains which are disastrous and affecting agricultural production the backbone of the country. Also, due to disparities in traditional roles, societal expectations, and livelihoods, men and women are affected differently by climate change. Women account for the bulk of Uganda's population of 23.19 million people. 
They have lower wages, less access to credit and decision-making power, and less control over resources, all of which make them more vulnerable to climate change. It’s therefore important to consider differences when tackling the issue of climate change.
 
Agroforestry/permaculture has emerged as a major instrument in the fight against climate change in recent years. It's a widely accepted answer to the twin problems of climate change and food security.
 It's one of a number of innovative strategies targeted at increasing production while also assisting in the mitigation of climate change by increasing carbon sequestration and boosting the system's ability to cope with the negative consequences of climate change.
This project aims to promote agroforestry/permaculture for climate change mitigation and the development of vulnerable groups' livelihoods, such as women, by planting fruit trees alongside food crops.

Through donations/contributions of GR 12 we already started planting of fruit trees. Most of our weekly updates on the project is weekly on our Twitter Page https://www.twitter.com/@ayowecca_uganda.

Demo video - 


Launched with the ability to send ERC20 tokens we now hope to expand the offering to NFT tokens and offer a pull method for our users.

So how does it work? Firstly, the user would need to have a list of addresses in a CSV file which then needs to be uploaded. Next, Multisend scans the addresses and makes sure that everything is in order, e.g. that all addresses exist, that there are no duplicates and that all are the correct format. The user needs to approve & simply press send! That’s it. Batch sending made simple.

We are using the Gitcoin grant programme to add new features to Multisend.org - We have an ever-growing list of new features and improvements to make. The next features we would like to add are as follows 

NFT token sending option 

This will open up the world of airdropping digital assets to NFT project owners and improve the ability to easily distribute ERC271 tokens to their community, competition winners etc.


Credits system 

Currently, Multisend.org issues a dynamic fee based on the number of addresses being used in a single Multisend - to reward high volume users we would like to build a credits system allowing users to purchase batches of tokens at a discounted rate.

Our mission is to reduce high schools dropout rates in low-income area by encouraging self-expression through visual arts & music.

My contribution to the foundation, after teaching guitars for 3 years, was a novel songwriting and producing class with the final objective of releasing a EP/Album with all the compositions of the kids every year.

Of course, everything stopped when COVID-19 showed up.

My teaching program, the scoring of a planetarium documentary (canceled because of covid) and every other (modest) revenue stream that I had disappeared.

Also, I was supposed to release of my first album as well as shooting a music video with Juno award winner KROY, but all of that fell on the ice as well.

I am looking to secure funding for the following objectives : 

1) Keep my songwriting & production program alive by adapting its format for our new covid proof virtual era.

2) Finishing & releasing my album (it's almost finished. You can listen to the latest versions on https://varfalvy.com)

We are a developer-centric protocol that loves to incentivize developer contributions to the ArGo Protocol. Our Beta V2 is just an inch away from being live and we are preparing to incentivize our developer community for bug bounties.
We will be using these funds to again give it back to our community and support further growth to ArGo Protocol. These includes:

	-		Bug bounty programs
	-		Sponsoring multiple hackathons
	-		Feedback Giveaway
	-		And many more incentives for developers

We are inspired by Gitcoin's support to the whole public goods community and we want to do the same. It's high time to start building OSS tools to support the growth of the Web3.0 ecosystem.

86,gitcoin-grants-core-team-dev-fund,"TLDR - The funds for this grant will be used to sustain the core Gitcoin team of software developers, product designers, dev relations, etc - to support Gitcoin Grants Development for Round 11 and beyond.

Our mission is to Grow/Sustain Open Source.  We are Open Source ourselves and need to be able to sustain and grow ourselves. How META!

Gitcoin Grants consume our team for about a month a half per quarter - we deliver all the product iterations (along with contributors we pay) needed to advance the product. We use these funds to pay for mostly developer and product salaries, but also marketing, customer service, fundraising, Sybil/collusion resistance data hunting and remediation. And of course, there are also server bills to pay, etc. This grant helps offset our costs and helps sustain open source software development. 

We have an aggressive roadmap to make Gitcoin Grants all that it can be. That means advanced research in mechanism design, L2 tech, bulk checkout, Sybil and collusion resistance — all stuff that comes bundled for free on our new shiny Gitcoin interface. We view ourselves as a leading Quadratic Funding R&D shop. Our work not only helps fund the ETH ecosystem, it also exports knowledge about QF and Sybil resistance to others. We want to prove what’s possible with both funding OSS & using Quadratic Funding mechanisms, and we want Gitcoin to be a “shining beacon on a hill” for other projects to look to.

We are committed to NEVER letting Gitcoin Grants become an extractive middleman, we continue to make budgeting and planning decisions with this in mind.

We have other irons in the fire as well (a great way to support Gitcoin is to run a hackathon with us, or to engage us on your devrel or Sybil resistance strategy!), but this Grant is one of our favorites bc it allows us to grow our sustainability along with everyone in the ecosystem. Aligned incentives FTW!

1101,archivenodeio-the-public-access-ethereum-archive-,"Update (March, 2022) - This time around we've updated our front-end website, offering a much more seamless and faster way for developers to gain access. As always, thank you everyone for all of your support!

Update (December, 2021) - we’ve reached over 1000 applicants for developers requesting access to ArchiveNode - hoorah! Currently we are working with developers as well to redesign and rework our front/backend, this will allow for a much more seamless onboarding experience to those requesting access, and will also cut down on the time it takes for developers to receive access from the moment they apply. Once again we are always grateful to Gitcoin and our supporters who helped make all of this happen!

Update (September 08, 2021) - Once again it's a Gitcoin matching round. While we are grateful for all previous support and future support we are not in dire need for funding at this very moment, but of course because we are a 100% free and open public goods service with operating costs and growth costs that aren't 100% free, we're once again keeping our grant open for this round. We are continuing to enable archive node access to more users at very quick rates, with almost 1000 users having access - that's almost 50% growth since the last Gitcoin round in June!

Thanks you everyone!
______________________________________________

Update (June 16th, 2021) - Hi all! And again, it's that time of year where grant round matching is live and we all come together to support projects in this ecosystem. Since our last update in March, we've supported another 200+ users, for a total of over 600 users with access to our archive nodes. This could not have been done without the help of Gitcoin Grants, which we are forever grateful. 

This round, we are going to keep our grant open, however, going forward we have very little infrastructure costs to maintain as we've been previously been able to support it with the help of funds we've received from Gitcoin. We have 3 different locations hosting multiple instances of our archive nodes. Any funds we receive this round will more than likely not be put towards the physical infrastructure required to run ArchvieNode.io, but rather the software side of things. To approve new users with access to our nodes, this is a tedious and manual process of having users apply, their application get sent to a spreadsheet, and then someone from the team manually approving it and then following up by e-mail, which often end up in the spam folder anyways.

Further funding will be used to allow for a better application process that includes automation and more convenience to our users, which is something we've been in need of since our previous Gitcoin grant round.

As always, we appreciate any and all support you've provided our project and hope to continue offering our service as a public good for Ethereum developers who need access to archive nodes but otherwise cannot afford them or run them themselves.
______________________________________________

Update (March 6th, 2021) - Once again, it's that time of year for another Gitcoin Grants round! Since the last round when we had just over 250 users, we're now at over 410+ users with access to our ArchiveNodes.

The infrastructure we've been able to build because of Gitcoin Grants has given us a lot of runway to support our current and future users, however for this Gitcoin Grants round instead of putting our money towards hardware we're going to direct it towards fixing/maintaining current hardware, maintaining our front ends, and still to hopefully build a better application process that includes more automation for the convenience of our users.

Thanks again for all of the support!

______________________________________________

Hi there!

It's that time of year again where we come together to fund some really awesome projects in the ecosystem - woohoo!

ArchiveNode is a free service provided by me (DeFi Dude) and Chase (MysticRyuujin) where we provide developers with free access to Ethereum archive nodes. ArchiveNode started as just a thought, ""why the hell are archive nodes so expensive to operate/access, and how can we fix that?"". This idea led us to reach out to Ethereum Foundation who were generous enough to offer us an AWS grant to get our feet off the ground.

While this grant is what helped us realize there is indeed a need for our service, it also made it painfully obvious how inefficient and expensive running a 4-5TB+ node in the cloud is, which is why we decided to utilize Gitcoin.

In the last matching round, ArchiveNode was able to raise over $10,000! With this, we were able to get more nodes (that we actually *physically* owned!), we were able to offer several client implementations, in multiple locations, and with redundancy. All together this money has helped us get over 64TB in SSD storage as well as other hardware to operate multiple nodes.

You can see the current status of some of our nodes syncing via ethstats.net (which you can also track):



Since inception, we've served over 250+ users with access to our archive nodes from all walks of life (students, developers, analysts, data scientists, PhD students, and more), while processing over 1,000,000 RPC requests on average every day! 

With future funding going forward, we plan to put funds towards advancing our infrastructure even further with additional nodes (currently Nethermind is only run in the cloud), a better front-end, improving our application/setup process to allow for a more seamless process while requesting node access, creating additional resources, among many other improvements along the way.

With that said, thanks to each and every one of you who have shown us support, whether verbally or financially - we continue to be grateful for this ecosystem, community, and the support they show us!

4251,connecting-web3-community-w-irl-climate-solution-,"TL:DR - We're a DAO initially focused on crowd sourced carbon removal technology development and IRL deployment (think: direct air capture) with a tokenization and governance structure that rewards contributors and project participants with true ownership in the success of the project.

We're essentially launching a carbon removal tech startup as a DAO. If we can prove out the model we'll continue to launch other climate tech moonshots as a DAO. 

THANK YOU TO ALL WHO CONTRIBUTED SO FAR!!

Description:

We are a growing web3-native, community-driven initiative to fund, develop, deploy and own IRL climate technologies & moonshot projects with a real chance of unf_cking our planet.




If our global economy continues on its current trajectory our planet is f_cked.
​
Every year we release 51 billion tons of harmful, ecosystem-transforming, greenhouse gasses (GHG) into our atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. 99.9% of our scientists agree that we'll need to get to net zero GHG emissions by 2050 if we want to avoid a global catastrophe. 
 
That means we’re going to have to decarbonize all areas of our economy. It’s going to be incredibly difficult to achieve this and we cant just rely on slow-moving world governments to cooperate and make it happen. If we're going to have any chance at all we're going to need ALL hands on deck. 
 
As a society we need to accomplish something gigantic, something that we’ve never done before, and at a much faster pace than anything we've ever done. To accomplish this, we need lots of breakthroughs in science and engineering. We then need to bring these technologies to market and scale them. All of this takes incredible amounts of expertise, effort, coordination, and capital. 
 
One of the major roadblocks preventing new climate-focused technology development and deployment is that new projects and startups are incredibly difficult to fund at these early stages. There are several reasons for this but mainly they need much more time to develop their technology, get to market and scale than most venture capitalists and project financiers are comfortable with. 

Many traditional investors are looking for a fast and massive return on their investment and climate tech just takes longer to get there - historically. It took solar and wind power decades to reach economic viability but we didn’t see VC join in until it was essentially proven and ready to scale. We could’ve had these technologies much sooner if we had more aggressive funding for early stage climate tech.
 
As a society we’ve made lots of progress so far but we’re going to need many more shots on goal, technological breakthroughs and a wartime mentality aimed at developing and scaling them. Without these things we won’t be able to avoid a climate catastrophe.


A decentralized problem requires a decentralized solution.

The overarching vision has always been to connect web3 & community with IRL climate solutions, technologies and moonshot projects.

The climate crisis is decentralized and we should all play a part in solving it. We should also have ownership in those solutions - especially the ones that are commercially viable and revenue generating. We call this regenerative finance, or ReFi, and here's how we think about it visually:



The initial vision for this project came from thinking about whether it would be possible to both raise web3-based funding, and leverage collective community intelligence, to fund and support the development and deployment of IRL climate tech projects & initiatives. And if we're able to build out this vision how could we enable climate tech founders, researchers, inventors, engineers, scientists, NGOs, and project developers to leverage what we've built so that they can do the same? 

Can a decentralized community build, scale and have ownership in the next climate tech unicorn like Tesla? 

Can we develop community-owned, utility-scale renewable energy projects and compete with the incumbent, unsustainable energy suppliers?    

Here is an example of how our project and community could fund and support the development and deployment of an individual direct air carbon capture (DAC) project whereby the community receives ownership in both the IRL startup and the deployment project itself:

 


Here' s an example of how our project could fund and support a climate tech startup studio (similar to an accelerator but with the goal of spinning out startups from within) and its spinout projects with ownership and incentives coming back to the community in exchange for funding and expertise:




All proceeds from this grant will go towards incentivizing our community, compensating contributors, building out our core team and developing the platform. 

To date the project has not raised any outside funding and has been working tirelessly on sweat equity and passion. Our goal is to grow organically without bringing in VC funding if we don't have to.   

We realize this is a massive and ambitious undertaking but that is exactly what we need in order to have any meaningful chance at solving our global climate crisis.

We ask that you join the cause, and our community, and would be incredibly appreciative for any support you could offer.

Multi-chain DAO Infrastructure Service Protocol

Project Q&A

Let’s first give some brief answers to some of the questions that everyone cares about, and there will be detailed information about the project later:


1.What is the RainbowDAO Protocol? What is the positioning of the RainbowDAO Protocol?


RainbowDAO Protocol is developed under the authorization of the Rainbowcity  Foundation, focusing on the creation of web3 basic component. RainbowDAO Protocol belongs to a multi-chain infrastructure service protocol. 

 Anyone can create and manage their own DAO organization through RainbowDAO Protocol, including independent DAO,alliance DAO, parent DAO and child DAO. Any DAO can also create a management department within the DAO to achieve multi-level management of the organization.


2. What is the Rainbowcity Foundation？



Rainbowcity Foundation is a non-profit foundation initiated and founded by Mr. RainbowKun. Headquartered in Singapore, Asia, it mainly engages in the incubation and investment of the crypto ecosystem. Mr. RainbowKun himself is a loyal fan of Bitcoin and a believer of Satoshi Nakamoto, dedicated to the spread of Satoshi Nakamoto's decentralized ideas. 

He once put forward the concept of ""Bit Civilization"" for the first time in the world in July 2021 at the Bitcointalk Forum established by Satoshi Nakamoto , hoping to promote the development of the encryption industry worldwide and practice the true Bitcoin spirit.


Mr. Rainbow Kun believes that in the crypto world, human civilization will have an unprecedented super economy in the future. It is constructed in the form of a decentralized protocol, which puts different and decentralized economic behaviors into a unified economy, and truly becomes the infrastructure of future human civilization in the future. The Rainbow city Foundation was established under this background.


The Rainbowcity Foundation plans to invest in 7 major areas in the next ten years, including Rainbow DeFi, Rainbow Investment, Rainbow Culture, Rainbow Network, Rainbow Industry, Rainbow Education and Rainbow R&D. Strive to become a super economy with a market value of one trillion US dollars. The RainbowDAO Protocol is the first project launched by the Rainbowcity Foundation to build the infrastructure of the DAO ecosystem and contribute our wisdom and strength to the development of the global DAO career.


3.What is the main purpose of your participation in the grant event this time?


The main purpose of our participation in this grant event is to promote the RainbowDAO project, to show the top-level design and technical architecture of our project to crypto investors around the world, and to recruit early contributors to the RainbowDAO community from all over the world.


4.Will the RainbowDAO Protocol issue Token in the future? Can I get airdrops from this grant event?


In the future, we will issue the governance token of the RainbowDAO Protocol: RBD, and ultimately the holder of the RBD will decide the upgrade of the RainbowDAO Protocol.


Regarding the economic model of RainbowDAO, we have detailed plans for the future, and here we will not promise that there will be airdrops. 


5.What are the social media of the RainbowDAO Protocol?


Since our project is officially open globally for the first time, our social media has just been launched. Welcome everyone to join our various social media to learn more about our project and become an early contributor to our project.

6.In which chains will the RainbowDAO Protocol be deployed in the future?


There are two versions of RainbowDAO Protocol, Solidity version on EVM and Ink! version on WASM.


The Solidity version is mainly deployed on Ethereum, BSC, Poygon, Avalanche, Fantom, and various L2 networks; the Ink! version is mainly deployed on the parallel chains on the Polkadot and Kusama relay chains, as well as other blockchains developed with the substrate framework. 


In the future, we will participate in the parachain auctions of the Polkadot network and the Kusama network to create a parachain with DAO  infrastructure service as the core.





Project  Details


1.Eight types of DAO industry:


DAO is more than a set of smart contracts. In essence, it is a social organization, a physical network composed of individuals with a common purpose. The code of the same smart contract, used by different groups, may demonstrate huge differences.  That sparks differences among DAOs. We did some research and collected the information about DAO in the encrypted world and initially divide DAO into eight major types:




⑴Protocol DAO


The DAO organization established by various DeFi protocols, the holders of governance tokens make decisions through voting and are responsible for the decentralized upgrade of the protocol.

⑵Investment DAO

The DAO organization established by various crypto investors, realizes the investment decision-making and benefit distribution of crypto projects through investment DAOs, making investment behaviors more transparent, fair and equal.

⑶Media DAO

The DAO organization established by various media practitioners, reconstructs the distribution method of media benefits, and allows information creators and consumers to share the value created by media.

⑷Developer DAO

The DAO organization established by blockchain developers, is committed to the development of various open source protocols and donates to developers to prosper the entire crypto world.

⑸NFT DAO

DAO organization established by NFT holders. Linking specific artists, NFT platforms, NFT works and NFT consumers, etc., to create longer-term value for NFT works.

⑹Company DAO

The DAO organization established by various companies, through the DAO to govern the main body of the company, and gradually improve the transparency of corporate governance.

⑺Government DAO

DAO organizations established by various government organizations, including various international organizations, non-profit organizations,, charitable organizations, etc., make governance more transparent, clean, and accept citizen supervision.

⑻Tool DAO

DAO, which provides infrastructure services for various DAO organizations, provides DAO operating system and various web3 tool plug-ins, improves the governance level and governance efficiency of various DAO organizations, and makes governance more diversified.


2.The current problems of DAO tool products:


With the vigorous development of various governance DAOs, the demand for DAO tools has also grown rapidly. However, we found that various DAO tools still have some problems, which cannot meet the needs of various DAO organizations at this stage. The following are some of the problems that we have summarized in the current DAO tool products on the market.




⑴ Single product function

At present, many  DAO tool products generally have the characteristics of single function, and they are far from being able to achieve some complex collaborative work. We hope to achieve some relatively complex collaborative work through the establishment of a series of DAO tools.

⑵. Low expansibility

At present, many DAO tool products generally have the characteristics of low expansibility, and cannot achieve function iteration and upgrade, which directly restricts the development of DAO organizations.

⑶.Low compatibility

At present, many DAO tool products generally  have the characteristics of low compatibility. There is no unified api interface or unified development document between each other, which can not be effectively compatible, and even more can not realize the role of collaborative governance.

⑷.Low diversity

At present, many DAO tool products generally have the characteristics of low diversity. Most products can only meet some general functions, and cannot meet the diversified and differentiated needs of the DAO organization.

⑸.Low operability

At present, many DAO tool products  generally have the characteristics of low operability. Especially for some novice users, the user experience is generally poor, and it is even more difficult to use these DAO tools.

⑹.Poor innovation

At present, many DAO tool products  generally have the characteristics of poor innovation. Most of them are learning from each other, the functional models are similar, and they have not essentially solved some of the pain points that are common in the DAO  industry.


3.Some difficulties in the current DAO industry


We found that although DAO represents the future and will develop into the basic organizational unit of human civilization in the future, and will reshape the pattern of human civilization, the entire DAO industry is still in the initial stage of development, and there are still a lot of problems and difficulties. We have now summarized some of the common difficulties in the DAO industry, mainly as follows:





4.The solution of RainbowDAO Protocol


Our Rainbowcity Foundation team has been conducting in-depth research on the DAO field. We hope to innovate on the basis of existing products in the industry and develop DAO tool products that truly meet the needs of the DAO market. After exploration and research, we decided to launch the RainbowDAO Protocol, and really set out to solve the pain points in the DAO industry.


In the RainbowDAO Protocol, we innovatively put forward the concept of DCV. The development of all DAO tools revolves around DCV. DCV, namely DAO Controlled Value. That is, the value is not controlled by a single individual or centralized entity, but by DAOs at different levels. Through the DAO governance contract, the DAO can control each core parameter and decision switch in the protocol, and ultimately the holder of the governance token will decide the development direction of the entire DAO through voting.


All DAO rules are open and transparent, and all decisions are open to the community. Fully transparent DAO governance is the most fundamental guarantee for increasing community consensus. Only when everything is transparent and open will it be fairer, better to gain the trust of the community, and to gather consensus among more communities.




5.The three major innovations of the RainbowDAO Protocol


In order to better meet the needs of the DAO industry, through the RainbowDAO Protocol, we have achieved three major innovations, which enable the DAO infrastructure to be upgraded and expanded infinitely, and truly meet the diversified needs of the DAO organization.




⑴ Govern DAO function：


Governance DAO is mainly reflected in two levels. First, the entire RainbowDAO Protocol is controlled by a governance DAO, and this governance DAO is controlled by the governance token RBD. The second point is that each independent DAO created through the protocol will generate a governance DAO, and the governance DAO is responsible for the modification of the independent DAO system parameters.

⑵Rainbow core function：


The Rainbowcore module is divided into four parts, RoleManage, AuthorityManage, RouteManage and CoreManage. The combination of these four functions makes the RainbowDAO Protocol a whole that can be flexibly matched with different roles and different permissions. In this way, unlimited expansion and upgrade of the protocol can be realized.

⑶DCV controller function：

Each DCV is an independent treasury system. With DCV as the core, we have innovatively developed the DCV controller function. Each controller is composed of a series of smart contracts. Through the DCV controller function, each DAO can flexibly control the assets in the DCV. In this way, the management of DAO has unlimited scalability.


6.Eight features of RainbowDAO Protocol


The three innovative functions of the RainbowDAO Protocol can be used independently or combined together. This makes the RainbowDAO Protocol unlimited scalability and upgradeability, and also allows the DAO organization created through the RainbowDAO Protocol to have unlimited Of diversification. It is with these three innovations that our RainbowDAO Protocol has the following eight features:




⑴ Modularity：

Each function of RainbowDAO Protocol can exist as an independent module, which can easily trigger upgrading and evolution of the protocol.

⑵ Plug-in：

Each module of the RainbowDAO Protocol is very flexible like a plug-in.

⑶Composability：

Each module of the RainbowDAO Protocol can be combined with each other. Some simple modules can work together to form a powerful module. 

⑷Scalability：

Based on the modular combination, the RainbowDAO Protocol has very strong scalability and new functions can be added through the addition of modules.

⑸Detachability：

The modules of the RainbowDAO Protocol can be disassembled to achieve the simplification of DAO functional modules and adapt to actual needs. 

⑹Interoperability：

Each module of the Rainbow DAO protocol is can interact with each other. 

⑺Flexibility：

The RainbowDAO Protocol can be combined, extended, and disassembled. This gives the RainbowDAO Protocol strong flexibility. The protocol can be adjusted according to the actual situation of each DAO.

⑻Growth：

Based on the first 7 features, the RainbowDAO Protocol will evolve into a living system that can upgrade infinitely with a decentralized idea. 

7.Eight concepts of RainbowDAO Protocol


With the idea of decentralization as the core, the RainbowDAO Protocol has always adhered to eight concepts to guide us in the exploration and implementation of the DAO field:




⑴Decentralization：

It is the soul of the RainbowDAO Protocol. The protocol itself and DAOs of all levels are decentralized. 

⑵Trust-free：

RainbowDAO Protocol adheres to the idea of ""code is law"". All rules are constructed by code with no need for intermediary.

⑶Censorship-Resistant：

All rules of the RainbowDAO Protocol are set by code to achieve complete on-chain governance, and the value of all assets is controlled by the chain. 

⑷Transparency：

The RainbowDAO Protocol realizes complete on-chain governance. All data is clearly displayed on the chain.All data is transparent.

⑸No need for permission：

The RainbowDAO Protocol is composed of countless rules that have been set up in advance. They are constructed by smart contracts on the chain. Anyone can use the RainbowDAO Protocol to build a DAO without permission. 

⑹Openness：

RainbowDAO Protocol is a set of open protocols and these protocols can interact with internal modules and external protocols. 

⑺Popularity：

RainbowDAO Protocol can be applied to various types of DAOs, large or small in size. 

⑻Inclusiveness：

The RainbowDAO Protocol can be employed by different types of people. We always hope to build the RainbowDAO Protocol into a viable, growing, and warm protocol.


8.Product  function display of RainbowDAO Protocol:

Anyone can establish an independent DAO organization through the RainbowDAO Protocol. Through this independent DAO, we can carry out three-part extension, and finally make this DAO infinitely upgradeable and expandable, allowing it to accommodate tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of user groups.




⑴Scale up: Alliance DAO

An independent DAO can join a Alliance DAO, such as  investment Alliance DAO, media Alliance DAO, social Alliance DAO, and so on. 

⑵Scale Out: Parent DAO and Child DAO

Each independent DAO can create child DAOs belonging to this independent DAO. This is equivalent to the relationship between the parent company and the subsidiary. The parent DAO can perform cross-level management on the child DAO, but the child DAO cannot cross-level management.

⑶Scale In: DAO department management

Each independent DAO can also establish a department belonging to this independent DAO. In this way, each independent DAO can establish its own clear organizational structure, and the department is managed by the multi-signature management committee. Only with clear division of labor and clear responsibilities can it be possible to improve efficiency and execution.




9.Design Mechanism of RainbowDao Protocol

The RainbowDAO Protocol allows unlimited expansion and unlimited upgrades of DAO. This part is the architecture design of the RainbowDAO Protocol, so that everyone can clearly know the design mechanism of the protocol.





⑴Tier 1 Architecture: RBD Governance Dao

The first layer of the RainbowDAO Protocol consists of RBD governance DAO. RBD belongs to the governance token of the RainbowDAO Protocol. The holders of RBD constitute the DAO and are responsible for the governance and management of the entire RainbowDAO Protocol. 

⑵Tier 2 Architecture: Basic Protocol Layer

The second layer of the RainbowDAO Protocol is the basic part of the protocol, which  mainly contains six parts:  rainbow core contract,  membership management contract,  revenue management contract,  web3  tool contract,   DCV controller contract, and  the DAO factory contract. 

⑶Tier 3 Architecture:DAO Factory

The third layer belongs to the DAO factory contract, which is mainly used for the batch creation and management of DAO. The DAO factory contract can be divided into three parts, namely DAO type contract, DAO initialization contract, and DAO management contract.

Our leader RainbowKun is a believer in Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin. He has been thinking about the philosophy of Bitcoin for the past four years. Since July 1, 2021, he spent 3 months writing more than 50 original articles on Bitcoin thoughts, and published them on the Bitcointalk forum created by Satoshi Nakamoto, sparking a series of extensive discussions. This is also the underlying idea that we initiated the creation of the Rainbowcity project and the RainbowDAO protocol.

850,studydefi,"Developing on DeFi and interacting with existing protocols (like Maker, Compound, Uniswap, flash loans) is very difficult. Each protocol has its own interface and conventions. Knowledge on how to work with them is often hidden away. This knowledge gap is what drove us to create a community called StudyDeFi.

Our goal is to help move the DeFi and Ethereum ecosystems forward by making it easier to build on top of these ""money-legos"".

Study Defi offers tutorials on topics like Forking off Mainnet  and Testing with Mainnet State and more. We show developers the fastest way to interact with DeFi protocols like swapping tokens on Uniswap or reading the MakerDAO Medianizer.

You can also join us on our Discord server where developers can ask experts about forking from Mainnet, working with existing DeFi protocols, and DeFi in general.

We are planning more blog posts and live webinars to help developers build on DeFi. The more money we raise the more useful content we can create for DeFi developers everywhere. At this stage, it would be great to form alliances and unite forces with others in the industry who are building on top of DeFi and in the greater open source community in sharing know-how and educational content creation. 

We have published an NPM package called Money-Legos, which we see as a public good and encourage the community to contribute. This package places the ABIs, addresses, and Solidity interfaces of major DeFi protocols at your fingertips with built-in Typescript autocomplete. This means you no longer need to be Googling and copy and pasting anymore.

Please try out Money-Legos and see if it saves you development time!

We are very excited to invite you to join our upcoming webinars on how to work with Maker, Uniswap, Compound, run tests on Mainnet and more!

Hi! I'm NatyShi and thanks to supporters helping me with this Grant I was able to create my YouTube channel and support all my contributions, adding value to the ecosystem, reaching more people who need to be masters of their destinies and financially free. 
I plan to continue growing adding more capabilities like tools to simulate and calculate potential earnings at protocol without even investing. WHY? Because I've found this insight from newcomers, where they are not able to understand where to invest, how much and for what amount of time to do it at least to be breakeven. I am trying to connect with different protocol teams to include this but as a non-dev (yet) I will need support from devs to work with me as teamwork. If you feel this would be a nice to have and yo want to support me to build this tool, among others, and work for it please help me with the grant. Also, if you want to contribute to help me continue developing learning material (and recognize my previous work :-) ), you can support me with this grant as well!

Everything you want to know about cryptocurrencies and blockchain in a free and decentralized world (DeFi) but explained in a simple way, step by step and in SPANISH so that everyone is encouraged to take the first step of many more, from beginner to advanced level! I invite you to follow me and support me.

I am a DeFi user since the beginning of 2020, where the pandemic accelerated my immersion and learning curve without realizing it. I found a world full of information being updated second by second, with very technical language sometimes, scattered in several platforms new to many, and more than 90% in English! This is a barrier for many who are just starting their journey and who also speak Spanish. So how could I leave my mark to improve it?

I set out to help others by lowering the barrier to entry and improving their user experience, generating my own material with analogies, diagrams and step-by-step guides on DeFi protocols and networks, as well as translating existing data and interviewing industry leaders to help them understand more about the ecosystem. My desire is to encourage you to take the step you dream to achieve financial freedom and help you improving your decision making and risk assessment that, even outside of DeFi world, will help you in your day to day life.

Hola! Soy NatyShi y gracias a los seguidores que ayudaron a este Grant pude crear mi canal de YouTube y agregar valor al ecosistema, llegando a más personas que necesitan ser dueñas de sus destinos y libres financieramente. 
Pienso seguir creciendo añadiendo más capacidades como herramientas para simular y calcular las posibles ganancias en un protocolo sin siquiera invertir. ¿POR QUÉ? Porque he encontrado este insight-pista de los recién llegados a DeFi, donde no son capaces de entender dónde invertir, cuánto y por qué cantidad de tiempo para al menos ganar y recuperar los costos de inversion (punto de equilibrio). Estoy tratando de conectar con distintos equipos de protocolos para incluir esto, pero como no soy dev (aun) voy a necesitar el apoyo de los devs para trabajar conmigo en equipo. Si crees que esto sería bueno y quieres apoyarme para construir esta herramienta, entre otras, y trabajar para ella por favor ayúdame con tu grant. Además, si quieres contribuir para ayudarme a seguir desarrollando material de aprendizaje (y reconocer mi trabajo anterior :-) ), ¡también puedes apoyarme con este grant!

Soy usuaria de DeFi desde inicios del 2020, donde la pandemia aceleró mi inmersión y curva de aprendizaje sin darme cuenta. Encontré un mundo lleno de información actualizándose segundo a segundo, con lenguaje muy técnico a veces, desperdigado en varias plataformas nuevas para muchos y en más del 90% en Inglés! Esto es una barrera para muchos que recién inician su camino y que además hablan español. Entonces, cómo podía dejar mi huella para mejorarlo?

Me propuse a ayudar a otros bajando la barrera de ingreso y mejorando su experiencia como usuarios, generando material propio con analogías, diagramas y guías paso a paso sobre protocolos y redes en DeFi, así como traduciendo data existente y entrevistando referentes del área para ayudar a entender más del ecosistema. Mi deseo es fomentar el animarse a dar el paso que tanto anhelan para alcanzar libertad financiera y a su vez mejorar la toma de decisiones y análisis de riesgos que, aun fuera de DeFi, los ayudará en su día a día.

889,litentry,"As we entrust safe-storage of our passwords and online activity data to third parties on the app-centric internet of today, we are often asked to comply with ambiguous and unfair privacy policies handing over control over our own data. As a result our data is often harvested and used in ways we do not have a say in.

Litentry Protocol is helping support change that in favour of a user-centric internet with blockchain.

Litentry is a fully decentralized identity authentication and user activity data management protocol. It is a secure and user-friendly alternative to Web 2.0 identity certification services (KYC) and it’s centralized user-data management facilities.   

Featuring 2FA and versatile software and hardware interfacing, Litentry protocol facilitates use of aliases authenticating them to a single real world identity and supports private identity management and usage data exchange.

Use of Substrate mobile lite-client support makes for architectural simplicity and enables Litentry to be completely independent from any third party server instead connecting directly to a customised blockchain and increasing security of identity-to-account relationship registration and usage data.  

Usage history is backed up to the user's storage enabling the individual to have full control over their data and seamlessly migrate their data between apps built with Litentry protocols.

Litentry Mobile App offers wallet and ID features for user interaction.
Litentry Modular Tool Library enables customised app development providing tooling modules for decentralized back-end identity validation and alias authentication. 

Work on Litentry started in September 2019 with our initial funding courtesy of Web3 Foundation. We have now finished the MVP including versatile interfacing, 2FA and modular blockchain tool library. 

We are currently building Javascript and Dart front-end to blockchain APIs. We aim to be ready for the beta version of client-side tools in Q3/4 2020 and to continuously support and improve our product in the future. 

Our long term goal is to popularise Litentry authentication for use in sharing economies, decentralized communities, real world designated-user spaces, qualification authorities, etc..

We are looking to build our team up to 5 adding a business development genius who can make us known to the world and a good front-end developer excited about the decentralized future. 

Would you like to join our team? Please get in touch with us and let's connect! 

Proceeds of this grant will help us on our mission of improving privacy and security of personal data. Litentry team is grateful for your support!

150,mccardi-ethereum-egift-cards,"Simple way to buy a virtual gift card for someone who is not in the crypto space, but you would like them to dive in.

The process is pretty straightforward:
Pick a card cover of our authentic designs
Then choose the value in USD you want to gift (5, 10, 20, 50)
Fund smart contract with Ethereum, that will be instantly converted to DAI, and stored in contract until the lucky person you gift it to redeems it
Share the love
Then the giftee can redeem the card at any time, specifying their Ethereum address, and smartcontract will release the amount of Ethereum worth value on the card. Person does not have to have Ethereum on their account, because buyer pre-funds the gas station requests, that will release locked on behalf of the giftee

There are numerous ways to improve the idea, like:
Add more storage and release options (ETH/DAI/USDT/ERC-721/etc)
Make actual printed cards to sell in every corner store
Add fiat gateway to purchase cards
Make corporate accounts, where gift cards can be accepted as partial/full payments for 3rd party services

However, it was decided to go with minimal yet very simple and understandable functionality and pleasant design to bring positive onboarding experience for people not yet in crypto space.

We are a team of three people:
David - https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-s-7aa72940 6y Python developer, Backend Engineer
Elena - https://github.com/elenapan - CS and Electrical Engineering graduate, Frontend Developer
Olya - https://www.shori.ru Graphics Designer, Artist

By our estimates, we will finish MVP in 1-2 months time, and hoping Gitcoin grant will help us free up some time to push this little project we are so passionate about to production (Mainnet). In case there will be substantial interest, we will progress further with advancing the functionality, making new awesome card designs, and attracting more people to Ethereum!

WalliD integrates certified ID document infrastructures (PKIs) from all over the world and connects them to the web-3, allowing users to digitize their physical ID documents, encrypt and store them on the blockchain using their Wallets as gateway.

WalliD provides the tools for users to store their ID documents in their desktops or phones while maintaining total ownership of their data - You will never need to create an account or share any personal data with us. Everything is handled and protected by your wallet. All data stored on the blockchain or any other components related to the protocol are encrypted with your own keys and you are their sole owner.

WalliD also delivers a set of technological components to be used for online services in order to request and validate users’ ID documents issued by CAs, directly in their technological infrastructures - PKIs - Everything happens in their websites or apps and they directly request your authorisation to access your wallet and share your ID documents. We are a team of developers on a quest to deliver full ownership to online users when it comes to their ID data and we will keep working everyday to make it as easy and useful as it is to turn your phone or desktop on.

 

Users' privacy and safety on the protocol



All ID data is encrypted with user’s wallet private keys and only the user has the ability to decrypt it.
All the interactions with the protocol components are handled by user’s wallet in browser or phone, eliminating the need to have accounts or logins.
Not even WalliD components have access to users’ data when they're manipulating it.
Data is only decrypted directly on users' trusted services. No more documents travelling through unsafe channels.
 

We dream of a world where owning and using an ID document in the digital space is as easy and safe as it is in the real world

Our daily activities have been greatly shifting to the digital world and a high volume of them require identity validation processes to be safely or legally completed. In the current days, users often need to take pictures of their ID documents and send them through unsafe channels multiple times,exposing their ID data to high risks of potential fraud. For businesses these ID validations are also a burden since they are extremely unfriendly to their users, take from 12 hours to 4 days to be complete and require expensive processes to implement and rely on third parties and human intervention as middle men. However, with the existing technology of digital certificates and public key infrastructures (PKI), there’s actually no reason for the existence of such archaic processes - It is mathematically possible to be sure that the ID document being presented belongs to right person according to a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) like a government.



Cryptographic proofs-of-identity



Blockchain Powered Safety:

WalliD is built on top of the Ethereum Blockchain and users can interact with it through their wallets in their desktops or mobile devices at anytime and anywhere
All iD Data handled by WalliD is protected and encrypted by users' wallet keys and he their sole owner.
Users' ID attributes are stored in WalliD's smart contract, ensuring the data integrity of future ID related transactions.


Trustless Validations:

Certified Documents are always verified within Certificate Authorities infrastructures (PKI) and do not depend on any middle men.
WalliD validator (VerifyiD) connects users’ IDs to CAs’ PKIs and provides a proof of the methods applied in it.


Digital Certificates at the roots of the ID documents:

The protocol is only compatible with documents with digital certificates attached.
Digital Certificates are used as a mathematical proof of ownership for an ID document.
All documents stored and shared through WalliD components are able to provide a chain of trust from their issuer to their owner verifiable in a trustless way.

SAGE GAZE: Vision

 Connect Individuals, foster experience building & knowledge development through educational-based smart contracts and the issuance of verified credentials. The settlement of smart contracts through the SAGE permits anyone or group the ability to prove themselves as prestigious, competent & trustworthy. 

 The SAGE strives to assemble a reliable network of verified academic peers & skill builders working towards a brighter future, with more transparency, equality & capability— increasing humanities talents, streamlining employment possibilities & opportunities.


What's a SAGE?

  A system of autonomous global education or a SAGE is a universally accessible open-source system for the advancement of learning. 

We call it D.A.S.ed; Decentralized Autonomous Society of Education. 

 The SAGE relies on no single contributor or centralized source. Instead, a network of peers participating in a shared worldview of open-source, decentralized collaboration, and reliability powers the SAGE. 

 The SAGE aims to change the way information is delivered and how the educational system fundamentally functions by treating each contributor in the ecosystem as equally capable. By leveraging the power of a distributed ledger and cryptographic signatures the SAGE can verify instead of relying on trust. A critical flaw of our modern educational structure.


The Goal: Open-Musaeum

 Ideally, people who earn verified credentials (non-fungible academic tokens) have assured & trustworthy ownership of an academic credential— a credential that would represent life skills. 

 Connecting Students/Individuals to Educators/Mentors with an autonomous, distributed and immutable overseer or SAGE. With verified credentials, there is no need to 'convince' an employer about abilities and competence.

 SAGE, an Open-Musaeum. Fostering and pushing forward the growth and establishment of higher-thinking and critical engagement of information for all of humanity. The SAGE aims to empower anyone, allowing access to work towards any skill and credential. Once earned, it's written in the sand. A person has obtained it, it's not transferable, it's provable ownership. 

 The SAGE takes steps towards independence– for humanity –forming channels for all of us to be 'humans of the earth,' not just a 'citizen of a country.' 

 Giving the same opportunities to a student and a teacher by giving control to the individual. Allowing the ability to teach or learn what you want, where you want and when you want. The SAGE provides base academic applications– distributed and decentralized. 

 Our focus is on accessibility and directed knowledge to strengthen humanity. Allowing for the creation of prestigious, immutable institutions & individuals backed by honesty and reliability– by incentivizing trustworthiness and consistent effort.


Where does the SAGE gaze?

  The SAGE has a small community of contributors so far. Most of which are in the established discord. The SAGE– in full form –works as a grand network of participants. 

We are building and designing: 

Decentralized Educational Apps (DEdu.apps) 
Digital Interactive Textbooks (DITs)
Learning Engines (LEs) 

Thus far; a prototype DIT is established called Idiot< Knowledge. There is a Gitbook in progress for the overall design and function of the SAGE.

 We are actively looking to increase the vision of the SAGE. We need builders, marketers, teachers and most of all life-students! If you can code, teach, write, speak or have other relevant life skills then jump in the Discord and find out how you can help out.

LED Token is a sport and health utility token (erc20) or ""smart contract"" written on the Ethereum Blockchain which focuses on rewarding users by following and completing workout regimes.

Products Developed

-LED performance dashboard which is a web application for monitoring physical activities and workout regimes and notifications. 

-LED Token wallet which integrates with MetaMask for token transfers

-LED healthy habit dApp which is an application that acts as a Piggy bank where you get rewarded by staking your tokens at the beginning of the week and rewarding you for completing your regime workouts at the end of the week.

-Moralis.io web3 servers for Multichain wallet and LED Defi exchange

In Development

-Currently we are developing an LED AI Jarvis coaching assistant built on Python which acts as an expert input/output question system using Speech to text, NLP, Scikit, and Numpy

-Crypto trading bots for automated trades

-MetaVerse Fitness center where you can workout and earn tokens for your body activities

-Also in the works is the API integration with the Native smartphone health app which will allow the health data to be converted into Cryptocurrency (LED tokens) and can be used within the LED health eco system or bridged to Ethereum for conversion

-We are also building a interplanetary file system (IPFS) for health records (ehr) which will hash encrypt patient data on a decentralized peer2peer network to secure the data. 

Users own their health data and can share it via the Blockchain to Doctors, Hospitals, Coaches/Trainers, Insurance companies using QRcodes. Patients and Athletes can earn LED token rewards and accrue them to pay for health services within the LED eco system or convert tokens back to Ethereum or Bitcoin. Gamers in the metaverse will be able to earn LED tokens by their physical activity.


Why LED

LED token is compatible and can be bridged to Ethereum and other blockchains like Polygon, Avalanche, and Binance. People can send & receive tokens to their LED Token digi wallets in a secured way and also earn tokens for working out. 

The LED app will be linked to a companion smart health app which will handle features like NFC crypto payments, LED Blockchain explorer for tracing transactions and also security & encryption to protect user health data as well as reward them for their targets/goals and healthy habits.

Since we launched last year, we've distributed thousands of magazines to 700 retail locations, including Barnes & Noble, Whole Foods, Books-A-Million, Chapters, Delta airport lounges, and many more. Plus, we've sponsored and run at least half a dozen educational workshops for women who want to manage their own digital wallets for the first time, garnering 10 community keyholders and matching dozens more with specialized mentors. You can read more about what we've done so far here. 

Next we need at least $45,000 to print the second magazine, created by a community with roughly 800 women, and complete the transition from a crowdfunded project into a DAO ecosystem. 




This crowdfunding project is led by:
 
Camila Russo- The Defiant founder, The Infinite Machine author, previously at Bloomberg News
Leigh Cuen- independent journalist, co-founder of the Association of Cryptocurrency Journalists and Researchers, previously at CoinDesk
Autumn Phaneuf- ETH Boston Chair, mathematician and engineer

You can create a community for your friends, or for strangers that are interested in similar things. All communities are public, and everyone can write to any community.
If you’re familiar with Reddit, Slashdot, or Usenet, it’s pretty similar. Aether does two main things differently though. The first is that it’s ephemeral. The content disappears after a while. The other is, the communities are democratic, they elect their own leadership.

The technical implementation is a peer-to-peer flood network sharing cryptographically signed messages. Posts are markdown-based text and everyone holds the entire network, which makes the data very cache-friendly with fast and reliable delivery. Since everyone holds all the network data, browsing is local, making it impossible to track user behaviour.

Aether's open source app has a polished interface with quick onboard via self-bootstrap. We build our beautiful app with love for our community and share our stories of building a peer-to-peer project.

Secret Sauce
 
BAF was founded and is composed of former and current leaders of different university blockchain clubs. We all experienced the same problem: blockchain companies were willing to sponsor our initiatives by donating their native tokens, but could not receive a tax deduction because universities don't accept nor process cryptocurrencies.
 
By incorporating our own 501(c)(3) nonprofit, we restored that incentive layer and built a stronger bridge between the industry and the university ecosystem. Donating to BAF means tangibly accelerating quality blockchain education while receiving a tax deduction and avoiding paying capital gains on the tokens you donated.

TL;DR; Gister is a fusion between Gist and Pastebin with a Hipster touch and wanna be a native web3 app when it grows!

The Gister team is working to provide a way to share notes, snippets, guides or even recipes (some developers love to cook) that are censure-proof, respect the privacy of the users and availability 24/7.

To the end of the April we expec deliver the following features:

Supports Formatic wallet and Wallet Connect
Support private gists
Enable edition and versioning of gists
Implement the follow/star feature on gists
Permission system on Ethereum Mainnet
Start a discussion about an economic model for gisters

At this moment we support public and unlisted gists, expiration and basic search on gists. The storage infrastructure is based on Sia Skynet for public gists access, but our vision includes integrate ethereum contracts to validate authenticity, authority, permissions, and profit. The projects is fully opensource and anybody can set up and instance and store its own gists in fully decentralized way.

442,the-still-unnamed-and-still-inexistent-project,"The (still) Unnamed and (still) Inexistent Project

This project is about creating a decentralised system for Universal Basic Income and Pension System for independent creators of Open Source Commons.

1. Summary

This project, purposefully, does not (still) have a name and it is (still) inexistent. It will be created in a collaborative and Open Source manner by starting by its very birth. The only things that I will (humbly) attempt to supply are the abstract in the following section and a proposal for a few next steps. For this project I will create a Gitcoin grant. Eventual funds received will be used up to my discretion until the governance is established (as in point 2 of section 3.), though, mostly to attempt to involve people in this project.

2. Abstract

As an in independent creator of Open Source commons (mostly software in my own case), I would like to challenge the current status quo by demonstrating that it is possible to create a Universal Basic Income System and a Pension System for independent creators of Open Source Commons without leveraging on centralised Institutions, States or Companies.
The idea is quite simple and can be described as the followings:

Creators can group in communities;
a creator can belong to more than one community;
creators choose the percentage on their earnings that they want to share with communities they belong to;
total incomings of a community are divided into funds allocated for UBI and funds allocated for PS;
creators get their split of funds allocated for UBI on a daily base;
creators get their split of funds allocated for PS when they want to.

3. Proposal For Next Steps

collect people interested in working on this project
define the decentralised governance of this project
choose a name for the project
iterate this file toward a green paper

4. How to be involved in the project

The project will be associated to a Gitcoin grant (as in a ""pre-funding"" stage);
As soon as I have a first funder, I'll open the GitLab project (eventually it will be moved later on);
Every person or company that funds the project in this stage will have access to the project;

5. Conclusions

I've no idea about how things will evolve, but hope this will be an interesting and engaging experiment for everyone.

552,defi-pulse-registry,"Funds from this Gitcoin grant will go to development of DeFi Pulse Registry: a new directory of DeFi projects committed to transparency about user risk. 

The addition of DeFi Pulse Registry to DeFi Pulse will help users make better decisions by making it easy to find reliable info about concerns like centralization risk (e.g., risks posed by a project's handling of admin privileges, economic risk (e.g., soundness of a project's economic model and assumptions) and security risk (e.g., thoroughness and findings of audits). In time, we will look to decentralize the management of this registry as part of a broader effort to decentralize DeFi Pulse. 

DeFi's exponential growth over the last year or so has been amazing. We think DeFi can maintain that growth rate by leveraging some of our space's most attractive features: openness and trust.  

Most new users know the general risks of crypto and DeFi, but things change so fast, and users struggle to get a true sense of each protocol's specific risks. Still, they trust us by locking lots of real value in our protocols and apps. Then when something goes wrong, many feel blindsided or betrayed and leave the space for good. 

We can build stronger relationships with users by trusting them with complete, current info about the risks they face. A DeFi protocol user with full knowledge of all risks involved is more likely to return after a loss than a user who was simply cautioned to do her own research and avoid risking too much money. DeFi Pulse Registry aims to build trust with users through openness about risk.  

DeFi Pulse is part of Concourse Open Community (along with projects like DEX.AG and ETH Gas Station). We're a small, distributed team, and we've been fully self-funded since our start in 2017. We're only interested in outside funding that doesn't require compromising our core values.

Our first service is called MetaURLs! 

They’re a personal way to share your NFTs, links, wallet addresses, bio and identity, and also receive messages. 

MetaURLs are multi-chain NFTs (you will be able to mint on a number of supported chains) and work natively on every browser as they’re DNS domains too! 

DNS domains and Metaverse IDs to bring about mass adoption of NFTs!  

We’re working on launching with a sunrise period for owners of ENS domains. If you own yourname.eth, only you will be able to mint yourname.me.link. 

For people who aren’t yet using NFTs and blockchain, MetaURLs provide a bridge by offering them an address that will make sharing their NFTs easier. 

And with an NFT gallery built in, there’s every reason to support and use MetaURLs!

We’re building our community organically on Twitter and are currently recruiting someone to manage discord and other socials. 

Supporting this grant will be greatly appreciated as we are building a social platform for everyone where the users will never become the product.

So when you invest your money in S&P 500 for example, you are putting your money hoping that S&P 500 Indexe go up.

So Gardes Index work the same way like Stock Market Indexes, It gives you information about a some of crypto currencies how they are doing. For example Gardes Index 20, groups the first 20 Crypto currencies by Market Caps, so if you invest in the first 20 Cryptos by bying the same amount of each one, the Gardes Index 20 will tell how much you are gaining profit if Gardes Index 20 is going up, and how much you loose if Gardes Index 20 is going down.

The liquidity providing market on Automatic Market Makers (AMMs), such as Uniswap or Sushiswap, is at the cornerstone of Decentralised Finance. 

Despite the billions being deployed in these pools today, liquidity providers hardly have access to the tools allowing them to measure their net yield and manage their investment efficiently. In consequence many investors, especially the smaller ones, are incurring losses when providing liquidity, if nothing is done they risk being discouraged and exiting the market which will have negative repercussions throughout DeFi.

Past: We collaborated with external Resarchers and produced original mathematical research on Impermanent Loss: https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06593

Collaboration and community
The Humanetics Workshop hosts a bimonthly meeting between practitioners and researchers in the PoP field to discuss breakthroughs, news, and common issues.
Similarly, Twitter Spaces and other similar popular services are used to interact with the general users of PoP protocols to foster a community.
The efforts of collaboration will culminate with The Humanetics Conference and The Humanetics Hackathon.
Education and research
A journal consisting of research papers on various topics within the PoP field, such as the collusion problem, the advancement of Artificial Intelligence, incentivization mechanisms, and others, will be supported by the Humanetics Workshop and led by its members.

We help you view NFTs associate with any of the ethereum addresses. Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs have shifted the conversation around art this year as collectors flock to to find the next Mona Lisa on the blockchain.
With millions of dollars exchanged for digital art each week - I can't help but wonder why there are so few options for actually displaying NFTs in both physical and digital spaces. It feels like an egg no one in the crypto art space has truly cracked yet.

Displaying NFTs in Real Life

Putting NFTs on display around your home or in a gallery requires more effort than hanging a physical work, but the results are often dazzling. NFT pioneers around the world have developed some pretty unique ways of sharing their collections using both analog and digital tools. Let's explore how they're doing it.

Digital Frames

Digital photo and video frames have come a long way in the past decade and many crypto art collectors have looked to these devices as a way of bringing NFTs to life on their walls. These frames come in all shapes and sizes and prices are all over the board.

We are joining forces to claim the historic site of the former Berlin-Tempelhof airport as a large campus where all the practices necessary for social-ecological transformation can be taught and shared. 

In our vision, the ""Transformation Center for All"" will consist of research cooperations with universities, participatory and repair workshops, educational offers on topics such as regenerative agriculture, renewable energy production, sustainable building, the common good economy and local, circular economy but also cultural offerings, artistic formats and much more! The center will be the home of an active civil society. Since the Tempelhofer Feld is already common property, we will ensure from the beginning that all offers of the center are accessible to all. 

We also collaborate already with the climate and social justice movements, both at city level and at neighbourhood level. We are confident that our vision provides a concrete climate action model that these movements can demand from its politicians. Additionally, we are in close contact with similar initiatives all over the world trying to establish transformation centers (or climate emergency centers as they call it in the UK) in different local contexts. 

Here is an overview over what we already achieved (Phase 0 - 3) and what we are planning for the future (Phase 4): 
Phase 0: Establishment and expansion of our network
Phase 1: April to June 2021: Preparation of public relations work
Phase 2: June-September 2021: Mobilisation/implementation of temporary projects, presentation of the vision, public relations work
Phase 3: September- October 2021: Presentation of the sketches of the “Transformation Center for All” at the Tempelhof site 
Phase 4 from 2022 - long-term until 2025: Acquisition of funding at federal and EU level in close cooperation with the Berlin Senate and district administrations; Opening of the first workshop sections of the transformation centre; Development and expansion in stages

With the support of the Gitcoin community, we would be able to continue our campaign work and move towards implementation of the “Transformation Center for All”. We would invest the money raised into a) our public relations work advocating for the establishment of the center, as well as in our ongoing networking activities on both, local and global levels; b) on facilitation of our several working groups; c) resources for transformation center (space, technical needs, workshop materials, professional services, etc.). The exact way of how the money would be spent will always be decided from the bottom up by all our members of the TH&F network.

2887,fund-for-nft-art-protection-monetization-through-,"Presentation 
 
Tokenart is the result of scientific and legal research. Directly inspired by the Creative Common project developed by the famous lawyer Lawrence Lessig, Tokenart brings a new standard to offer the creative world the possibilities allowed by the blockchain. It strikes a balance between the traditional “all rights reserved” framework resulting from copyright and the open framework of open source such as the Creative Commons promoting the free flow of creations. It helps artists protect and monetize their creations in the 177 states that are signatories to the Berne Convention. The Tokenart solution gives everyone, from individual creators to large companies and public institutions, simple and standardized License for representing the rights attached to a creation on NFT. 
 
Objective pursued

Answering this question : What I am buying when I am buying a NFT ? 

Tokenart License helps define the rights of both owners of ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as well as artists and creators working with NFTs. 

Tokenart License is designed to balance two concerns : 

*Protecting the hard work and ingenuity of creators 
*Granting users the freedom and flexibility to fully enjoy their non-fungible tokens 

We may meet with some legal misconceptions by continuing this road. ""you own the NFT. And since you DON'T OWN THE COPYRIGHT, usage is licensed to you..."" 

The real question is: do we want to define ownership in blockchains are built in the Open Source environment nature.

We answer YES because even if blockchain are opensource based, Tokens are ownership based. There is no ownership over Bitcoin source code but there is one over Bitcoin tokens. This is the same for NFT. 
License will just helps increasing value.

Our community
 
Our community will soon be provided with a Tokenart token which will allow it to
- Vote for future updates of the technical standard
- Vote for future legal licenses
- Be paid to validate identities and artists
- Be paid to settle disputes in intellectual property law
- Receive rewards related to Tokenart activity such as reputation tokens
 
What solution, for what problem?
 
Today we are faced with three problems:
 
-Earning a living as an artist and creator is a challenge. The art NFT market helps some artists who specialize in creating digital art. But it is not the majority. Serious art projects find it difficult to make a place for this as they are drowned in online scams. Many artists would also like to share their creations and not just the cryptographic hash of their digital files.
 
- Current NFT standards do not allow creators to prove their authorship on their creations or to secure and monetize their copyright through their NFT. They also do not prevent acts of counterfeiting. This created division and friction within the creative universe.
 
- Free licenses allow you to share rights without being able to monetize them 
 
Solution : We have developed a new secure and legal standard License in over 177 countries around the world. 

These standards answer to these questions :
 
- What am I allowed to do with the creation associated with my NFT? 
- What am I NOT allowed to do with the creation associated with my NFT?

​What are these standards License ?

Standard License helps creators to sell through NFT royalties, commercial use over their creation and even physical goods like famous unisocks!. 

Find our logos and sum-up : HERE 

Digital NFT license : TA-DI 
 
Basic NFT for creator artwork. Only the NFT linked to the Digital artwork is represented by the NFT. Nothing change with traditional NFT except that creator register his IP right & benefits of Tokencop protection.

This is totally compatible with opensource Licence Creative Common
​
Physical NFT : TA-PH
 
The NFT only represent the ownership over the physical described artwork. No other Intellectual property right are represented by the NFT. This means that the NFT is linked to the physical creation and the seller engage himself to deliver the physical piece when the NFT is bought.

This is totally compatible with opensource Licence Creative Common
​
Totally represented by NFT : TA-TOTAL
 
All of the creators right over his creation are represented by one or more NFT that creator creates.

This is not compatible with opensource Licence Creative Common
​

 Right of commercial use - TA-CU
 
The commercial use is Exclusively represented by one or more NFT that creator creates and only the NFT owner can exploit it. This means that once creator’s NFT is sold the creator prevent himself to use his artwork for commercial use.

It can be mixed with the following opensource Licence Creative Common : CC-BY-NC ; CC-BY-NC-SA ; CC-BY-NC-ND
​​
​
 right of modification and sharing / using modification - TA-M
 
The creation modification right is  represented by one or more NFT that creator creates. The modification right is shared between the creator and the NFT owner.

​
 right of modification and commercial use - TA-CU-M
 
The commercial use and modification right are represented by one or more NFT that creator creates and only the NFT owner can commercially exploit or modify the creation.

It can be mixed with the following opensource Licence Creative Common  : CC-BY-NC-ND
​

Token NFT : TA-RO

The NFT represents a part of the royalties (in English ""Royalties"") that an intellectual good can procure. The licensor offers the buyer the right to a royalty (""Royalties"") on the fruits of commercial exploitation up to the percentage written in the NFT.

​
Token NFT : TA-TO
 
The NFT only represent the ownership over the Digital file + token represented. No other Intellectual property right are represented by the NFT. This means that the NFT is linked to the token creation and the custodian engage himself to deliver the token when the NFT is regive.

Although what we're building is related to sim racing it can also be adapted for other kinds marketplaces and private content.

🚀 What is unique about SimThunder?

There are already centralized services that sell this kind of items, but there isn't yet any decentralized marketplace where anyone can buy/sell access to private content. We aim to create the first decentralized marketplace for private content and NFTs related to sim racing eSports, where everyone can sell and buy this kind of assets. This can easily be adapted for other kinds of private content.

 🦾 How is SimThunder using Cartesi?

Cartesi plays a fundamental role in our project because it enables two parties, who don't trust each other, to securely trade access to private content data. By using Cartesi's Descates we are able to make the transactions between the 2 parties verifiable and thus to make it possible to resolve disputes regarding the access to the private content data.",https://simracercoin.com,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,https://github.com/michaelis,2

4260,genethic,"About
In early development, and part inspired by real events, Genet[h]ic (previously Methuselah) is a thriller around a journalist investigating the suspicious deaths of patients treated with a miraculous gene therapy.

The Problem
Cinema tends to portray longevity in dystopian terms, for example, In Time with Justin Timberlake. If longevity science is to achieve widespread popular acceptance these visions need to be countered. The longevity community must take positive counter action, and we need to show, not tell, in order to reach mainstream audiences. 

The Solution
Our goal is to offer a fresh, positive perspective on longevity. To change popular perspective we must provide insights into tangible benefits of gene therapy and do so in both relatable and commercially appealing ways. Film is a vehicle for this, and Genet[h]ic will be one of these stories.

Use of funds
Preproduction development costs and casting. The aim is to raise the seed money needed to bring the film to a point where it can attract funds for full production. By casting known actors and emerging talent under a renowned director, our goal is to sign with one of the big distribution companies i.e Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures.

MetaLove DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a non-profit, decentralized, autonomous organization focused on children with autism that operates autonomously without centralized control or third-party intervention by encoding the organization's governance and operating rules in the form of smart contracts on the blockchain.
MetaLove takes the form of a DAO for the management of funds and governance of the organization, combining decentralization, autonomy, and self-governance with pass-through economic incentives, as some of the token functionality has yet to be implemented, and the MetaLove DAO is currently still in the test net phase. This will be a new step in the crypto community's exploration of sustainable and transparent open public goods.

3509,freedom-of-the-press-foundation,"Founded in 2012, Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that protects, defends, and empowers public interest journalism in the 21st century. We believe that a thriving free press—one that can change the course of history—depends not only on strong advocacy, but also on actively empowering journalists and whistleblowers to do their job in the face of adversity.  

Building the Next Generation of Secure Communications Tools - In the age of surveillance, news outlets face increasingly dire legal and technical threats to their work. FPF builds the most important tool there is to help them: SecureDrop, the open-source whistleblower submission system that provides journalists a safe and secure way to contact sources. SecureDrop is used by over 75 major news organizations worldwide, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, ProPublica, Associated Press and many more. Now available in 21 languages, SecureDrop is seen as an increasingly critical tool for all news organizations in the U.S. and abroad.

Monitoring Press Freedom - In recent years, both verbal and physical threats against the press in the United States have escalated exponentially. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker project, ​launched in 2017, documents and counts virtually every type of press freedom violation in the United States—from journalist arrests, camera searches and seizures, subpoenas, and physical attacks to surveillance orders and whistleblower prosecutions. Since its launch, we have documented more than 1,000 press freedom incidents affecting reporters across the nation. This first-of-its-kind database is now the backbone of advocacy efforts of every press freedom organization in the country.

Empowering Journalists with Digital Security - It has never been more important for journalists to protect their sources using technology and encryption tools from the moment they start speaking to them. FPF is the only U.S.-based organization who has a team of digital security trainers to assist journalists in protecting themselves online through the Digital Security Training Program. We go inside newsrooms to teach journalists how to lock down their accounts to prevent hacking, how to protect their anonymity online, how to mitigate potential harassment or doxing, and how to encrypt a variety of communications methods such as text messages, phone calls, and emails. Well over 3,000 journalists have attended at least one of FPF’s trainings over the past three years.

Advocating for the Press - In order to fulfill our mission of protecting and promoting the basic human right of freedom of the press, we engage in public and legal advocacy around critical press freedom issues. Our advocacy efforts focus on issues such as excessive government secrecy, the persecution of whistleblowers, the dangers of surveillance of journalists, the importance of the Freedom of Information Act, and protecting the right to publish. We have a large social media following, a well-read website, and robust media profile to push our message centering on strong press freedom rights for all. Additionally, we have a high profile board of directors who allow us to amplify our message even further.

2637,living-bit-by-bit,"In a recent news article published in Yahoo news about cryptocurrency, ~14% of American adults invest in cryptocurrency. When breaking the numbers down by age, 74% of cryptocurrency owners are between 25 and 44 years, 19% fall under the ages of 45 and 55, and sadly the number of 56+ are non-existent.

With mass adoption comes validity, liquidity, and security. The more individuals who participate in a cryptocurrency, the higher the probability of becoming accepted by the mainstream public and less likely to be seriously threatened by regulators. Moreover, an increase in the number of participants in a protocol will also increase liquidity in the protocol's native token, which means that investors can get in and out of a position any time they choose, with a minimal amount of price slippage. Lastly, the more people that participate in a ""public blockchain,"" the more secure a blockchain can be by investors staking tokens to secure the network (if using a proof-of-stake type protocol).

The author of this post proposes an initiative to reach out to individuals in age ranges who would not usually use cryptocurrency or understand the underlying blockchain technology that secures it. The initiative will utilize popular social media platforms used by the targeted audience to educate and inform them on the safe use of cryptocurrency and the benefits that blockchain technology can provide. The outcome of the stated initiative is to onboard as many individuals as it can, thus adding to the exponential growth and adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.

2470,fungyproof-verify-the-quality-of-your-nfts,"FungyProof is a grading system for NFTs based on objective technical considerations. The rubric scores tokens based on an ethos of decentralization, immutability, ownership, and sustainability. 

Version 1.0 is live. Give it a try: fungyproof.com

UPDATE: Embeddable badges are now live! Check them out at badge.fungyproof.com.

Background

There’s a good way and a bad way to build an NFT. 

The latest hype-cycle has exposed some challenges with NFTs and the current state of the ecosystem. These challenges are putting high-value assets at risk and minimizing the ethos/benefits of the ecosystem.

Contract/transaction fees can be prohibitive
Participants often pay “middleman” service fees on top of contract/transaction fees
Asset storage/linking is often stored in centralized servers
Participants may not control the assets storage account and lack visibility into asset hosting.
Assets storage/linking is often vulnerable to single-points of failure 
Some platforms reliant on http gateways or vulnerable urls
Many participants do not have metrics/tools other than “memability,” to determine the quality of NFTs
Risk assessment is lost amidst press of “high-dollar sales”
Even savvy participants may struggle to find token data

FungyProof 1.0

The first version lets you enter an OpenSea URL and get a grade. You can also check out the data pulled from the token and get explanations of your grade. 

The current categories that contribute to the tokens overall grade include: immutability, metadata, eco impact, marketability/interoperability

Grading Rubric:
A+ = most future proof (relative immutability, low enviro impact, creator owns/controls all assets)
B
C
D
F = least future proof (single point of failure, high enviro impact, creator does not own assets)

Use of Funding

As the ecosystem grows there will be more complexity for people to navigate and we believe this tool will be helpful for quickly getting insights and data on tokens and platforms. 

The funding will allow us to continue building out our roadmap and contribute more of our time to researching platforms and new tech and pay for infrastructure.

With your support we can provide this grading service free of charge for everyone.

2087,nft-gospel-everyday-grant,"THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING! <3


Hello & GM world.
My name is Logan, I'm the creator of NFT gospel.

It's my mission to teach people about Web3 EVERYDAY!

I need your support so I can stay afloat in this wild web3 industry EVERYDAY

My mission is to on-board, interview artist, and dedicate my LIFE to Web 3.0.
(You can check my videos out on YouTube, @ NFT gospel)

My DREAM: Is to make a short film one day. 
I'm currently documenting artist EVERYDAY as we speak.

I want to tell the story of everyone EVERYDAY
NFT collectors, NFT artist, Crypto enthusiasts, degens, and even Anti Nft folk.
TO TELL the most RIGHTEOUS of stories from around the world. 
It's SO important & a BURNING passion of mine to make these videos.

I'm currently focused on making YouTube videos.
Without this awesome GitCoin Grant I wouldn't be able to stay afloat in the NFT industry.
Your support is the reason why I continue making this against the stream journey. 

THANK YOU!

MY GOALS 

SHORT TERM:

SIMPLY Make more EDUCATION content EVERYDAY! 

I already have an amazing following on social media, but we need to hit a global audience.

Currently we have over seventeen thousand followers on twitter that push us to do better EVERYDAY!

Twitter is amazing place to socialize but not the best place to learn from a beginners perspective. 

My YouTube on the other hand has a small but amazing following we just hit over 1 thousand subscribers!

We Need to utilize the channel more effectively so we can GET THIS MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE EVERYDAY!

What does that mean? 

We need to be hitting a daily goal of ATLEAST FIFTY DOLLARS EVERYDAY to keep food on the table so content can be posted EVERYDAY!

I've been building for this last year and have spent almost all my savings on this project. I'm down to a very small portfolio. Without your support I fear I'll have to put this whole operation on hold. 

Our goal is to fundraise just a little over eight thousand dollars within the next couple of days (by the end of March)
so we can bring to the team more writers, film more IRL events, have more live stream, feature smaller artist, etc. 

This grant will be the ONLY significant profit we've made within a year. 
I don't work a (9-5) job & have put EVERYTHING INTO THIS PROJECT!

This operation has been out of pocket EVERYDAY this whole time! 



LONG TERM:
I want to start traveling and teaching the NFT GOSPEL EVERYDAY!

this includes things like going the extra mile to make sure people truly understand the power of decentralization.
It's important to me that people everywhere understand that this IS'NT SOME SILLY FAD!
THE BLOCKCHAIN IS FOREVER!

I would love to one day be invited to travel to schools, universities,
heck even churches to PREACH THE NFT GOSPEL LOL.
That would make my life goal complete. 
I would finally be able to die happy knowing I had a huge impact on the future.
EVERYDAY I want to be able to deliver these profound learnings and transform them into easy to digest teachings!
The power of Web3 IS shaping our future generation! 

THATS WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT TODAY SO WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN EVERYDAY!

I want to make a mini documentary series on NFT artist,
& how it has revolutionized thousands of peoples lives all around the globe!
This is my goal long term. 
That is why I've been interviewing amazing artist this whole time.

OVERALL:

Meeting all of these awesome people all over the world is the reason I DO THIS
Waking up everyday to explore the Metaverse finding these highly talented people,
 from all over the globe brings me great gratification. 
Making people laugh, love, & FEEL is the best way I can see myself spending my time.

I encourage anyone willing to be featured on the show to reach out. 
I'm very humbled to meet every single person.
sharing exciting moments with you is what I'm here for!

Please consider donating, anything helps :-)

2523,pharo-automated-cover-market-maker,"Pharo is an evolution of the Automated Market Maker concept (AMM), which we call an Automated Cover Maker (ACMM). An AMMM has Buyers, Sellers, and Liquidity Providers; while an ACM has Buyers, Events, and Liquidity Providers. The protocol in both cases is optimized for their two sided marketplace; In an AMM, Buyers and Sellers are facilitated by Liquidity Providers who assume the risk of completing a swap. In an ACM Buyers are affected by the real-world Event, and save for its inevitability, while Liquidity Providers assume the Event risk and provide stability over time. 

There are endless events and combinations of. These undead Mummies incentivize believers, aka Buyers and Providers, to buy cover early and to stake Event odds that maximize their returns, coronating a Pharo. 

A Pharo’s risk balances between: the greatest payout, unclaimed liquidity, unclaimed demand, $PHRO token rewards, and clarity around the event. $PHRO tokens are distributed to stakeholders along a bond curve that rewards believers.

Eventually the fog of uncertainty around an Event lifts, belief is no longer necessary, and Imhotep locks unmet demand with new Liquidity Providers. Imhotep has no power to reward $PHARO tokens.

Emergence of Events is managed as a DAO using $PHRO tokens. When the Event is triggered either way, Anubis distributes the Pharo’s body as $PHRO tokens to its believers. Believers are immortalized in the Pharo’s Obelisk, allowing anyone and everyone to know who bought in, what risk they took, and their constitution of Pharo.

Imagine a Different Kind of Insurance Industry

One where all parties in the insurance value chain have the same risk data at the same time. The data is linked automatically to smart contracts which can trigger automated processes. Everyone trusts the accuracy of the data and can share it easily. There could be a platform for more collaboration and greater transparency. With many activities automated and some eliminated entirely, administrative costs would be reduced. All actors in the value chain could focus on higher-value activities and delivering better client service. The industry would become more efficient. Innovation and profitability would flourish.

Litepaper
Summary

The multi-trillion-dollar insurance industry is dominated by huge corporations, saturated with global institutions, constrained by heavy regulations and plagued by misalignments of company and consumer incentives. The insurance world has devolved into an inefficient, expensive, and ultimately frustrating industry. When customers most need help, they can end up fighting in vain for reimbursement from companies whose profits depend on them not paying out.

Insurance industries can’t provide coverage for many markets… they can’t pivot. If you have ever read an insurance policy, or tried to file a claim, you are probably aware of the hidden complexities with traditional insurance. Or, you’ve found out that the insurance you purchased doesn’t protect you against the risks that you thought were covered, or you may not have met your deductible. These are the gaps in insurance that cause financial impairment. 

Most insurance is based on historical data that actuaries use to determine the “price” of coverage so that the insurance company will maintain their profits. In 2009, two events occurred that have proven the inability of the insurance industry to adapt to emerging risks. It’s now 2021 and  the industry is still trying to understand the risks of UBER and bitcoin, let alone DeFi and that is the reason a Decentralized Risk Protocol is paramount for the health of the entire ecosystem. Pharo allows consumers to identify and manage emerging risks through unique mitigation approaches, using digital assets as a hedge against potential losses.   

Pharo is building a protocol for decentralized risk management products and applications. Individuals, businesses, large and small, nonprofits, and fintech and insurtech startups can all come together to provide better products and services. 
We aim to use blockchain technology to help make the sale and purchase of risk more efficient, enable lower operational costs, and  provide transparency into the industry. Blockchain can provide the means to disintermediate the market with a peer-to-peer risk platform that helps us act as society's safety net. We envision new individuals building their own markets and products on top of the Pharo protocol.

How It Works, The Market Manager

At the core of Pharo, a fully Automated Cover Market Maker (ACM), is an on-chain risk management protocol built on top of the Ethereum blockchain (Polygon, Cardano, Binance Smart Chain to follow), backed by smart contracts to guarantee safety thereby removing the need for  any middlemen. Pharo’s ACM protocol operates as a proxy between the Liquidity Providers (LPs) and the Cover Buyers (CBs), offering service fees to LPs, and cover to CBs. 

PHARO Protocol Actors:
Market Managers: Create new Pharos and recognize an event or events around which a market can be brought on-chain and created with a Pharo.
Liquidity Providers: Deposit assets to Pharo Risk Pools to provide liquidity for the cover buyers while earning interest and $PHRO tokens.
Cover Buyers: Buy cover from a Pharo and provide the service fees to the market managers, the liquidity providers and reserve pool. Cover buyers also earn $PHRO tokens.
Stakers: Deposit $PHRO into a Stake Pool earning $PHRO and voting power in the Pharo DAO.

Pharo’s secret weapon and scaling champion is the Market Manager so let’s focus on that actor  first . The Market Manager plays the most important role, and that is the role of creating the Pharos based on events they are familiar with. This means not only does the Market Manager have knowledge of their market, they also have a network of people that can act as either LPs or CBs that they can market to. With that being said, the Market Manager stands to earn the most profit by being first to establish the market.


Choosing a Market
The Market Manager is someone who has a good understanding of the market they are creating the event for and familiar with its triggers. It is in their benefit to set initial odds that are closest to the reality they understand.Creating a new Pharo is an important job done by the Market Manager who deposits $PHRO, defines the event, and sets parameters like how long the Pharo is active, LPs profit percentage, and the trigger. With a Pharo in hand the Market Manager is ready to advertise to LPs and CBs and bring the Pharo out of the mummy state.

In sum the Market Manager will be creating many events, experimenting with which specific conditions, which thresholds, which rewards, which timelines, will maximize their revenue and total payouts.

Pharo LLC Heavy Lifting
Each adapter/job is requested by the Market Manager with a simple online form at no cost. 
The new event defined by the Pharo can and will be brought on-chain with the Pharo team’s support when the event trigger is not readily available or built. Pharo creates an adapter/job to monitor the outcome of each event. 

$PHRO Rewards
Market Managers earn $PHRO token rewards for every event they create. After the event is triggered, the Pharo (Pharo in Anubis state) pays out the rewards to all actors. The Market Managers rewards are calculated based on total capitalization of the Pharo, so it is wise to know your market for maximum returns, meaning the more LPs enter your Pharo the more rewards you will earn. 

LPs and CBs also earn rewards, LPs earn based on odds convergence and amount staked, CBs will earn rewards based on how close to the converged odds they come, where they are in first-in-first-out index,  and for the amount of their cover they bought.

Fees and Profit
Initially 80 percent of all Service Fee Payments will go to the Market Manager (the Market Manager will decide the LPs percentage on event creation as well as the fee for the Agent/Referrer if needed), with the remaining 20 percent being the Pharo Fee and sent to the reserve pool (See example Fee diagram). *The Pharo Fee will be modifiable by a PIP or Pharo Improvement Policy in the future and managed by the Pharo DAO. More to come on the DAO.

ULAND is a project based on virtual land that mirrors our earth’s geographic!.!

All geographic locations are based on the real world. Initially, we will release countries, states /
provinces (depending on the country) and cities. Once supply has been exhausted
further locations will be released such as iconic landmarks, historic sites, national parks etc


The Concept

The first partis the NFT’s in ULAND.

ULAND’s Land Asset NFT’s have been devised with real, economic utility and benefit.

Unlike traditional uses for NFTs in the digital artwork space, ULAND’s NFT’s are real geographic economic location-based assets you can own; such as countries, states, cities, oil rigs, airports…even the Eiffel Tower, someday!

The second part is the economy of ULAND. Coupled with the location NFT’s we wanted
to create an insulated and free economy where Ulanders (people who own
land/location assets and citizens of ULAND) can freely trade and engage with eachother, just like you would in the real world. Except there is no government and financial institutions to control how you do things.

We wanted to create an ecosystem that is insulated, self-propagating and safe. In order to achieve this, $ULAND tokens were created as the currency in ULAND, whose value is based on Liquidity. A percentage of every transaction in and out of ULAND will be stored and locked away as Liquidity to organically and continuously grow the value of $ULAND tokens, thus creating a safe, secure investment for our ULANDERS.

ULAND is about freedom. Imagine Mother Earth, with all its current nations,geographic wonders (manmade or natural), beautiful cities, incredible nature parks; all free of traditional bureaucracy and owned by YOU the people, where you can make the
rules and choose what to do with your piece of land without interference from anyone
within a safe and fair economy.

Because this project is for the people, YOUR input will be of utmost value to us, as you
will have a say in the shaping and the creation of ULAND.

Welcome to ULAND!


                             PLEASE FUND US!!!

We have already gone a long way with this metaverse project that would soon take over the world!! 

But we need partners, contributors and funders that would help propel this project to the next level! 
OUR GOAL is to create a metaverse where normal everyday people can go to buy and own virtual properties which would appreciate with time(because of the intrisic value we would give this properties over time) thus helping them earn money for themselves . 

Futuristic thinkers would understand the concept of this project. This project would also shine more light on what we can achieve together with the metaverse. 

Early Contributors shall be awarded lands in ULAND!

Thank you as you become a ULAND PARTNER/CONTRIBUTOR!!

BIG  CONTRIBUTORS ($500-$1000) would be given a state in ULAND.  $1000 and above CONTRIBUTORS would be a country.

THANK YOU AS YOU CONTRIBUTE!!

976,magical-machine-money,"Hi Grant, please enjoy this update and a kind of synopsis of how MMM is developing in the text below. 

/// 2022_update

It's been a huge year. 

The explosion of every fundamental metric you can apply to the space has been impressive. One of the biggest shifts that I have been cognisant of over the course of the last year has been the diminishing influence of the largest blockchain by market capitalisation. All roads lead to Ethereum. 

Increasingly see that the production of Magical Machine Money is going to be the 'most good' that I can do - maximum impact is imo derived from increasing participation. The largest pool of untapped interest is yet to come from bringing those still left behind in the legacy economy into the fold. The world seems to be at a point of maximum disillusionment with existing power structures. The very fabric of society has been degraded significantly over the course of the pandemic.

The parallel economy being developed on Ethereum is capable of engineering an entirely new infrastructure on which society can grow on. The main focus of my work in the realm of tokenisation was to successfully extrapolate how the space would evolve to start encapsulating the real world. It has happened so fast in fact that I was barely able to get my thoughts out before they became reality while also working on them myself through creative agency.

The merge between blockchain and the real world that we have seen over the last few years has been relatively straight forward and logical. Niches of the meat space have been captured, companies have moved toward adopting blockchain technology and are beginning to see the depth of the space. 

Finding synergy with the objectives of society at large is going to be a much more complex and rewarding process. There is a pathway emerging. Blockchain has overall been gaining legitimacy as its utility is demonstrated over time. Detractors like to point to the environmental impact of blockchain technology. That will soon become a mute point with the move to proof of work, it does make for an interesting comparison however. Even with the most energy intensive consensus mechanism can not come close to the damage done by traditional financial institutions who's tentacles reach into every corner of society. 

Diluting the petrodollar and highlighting how blockchain can facilitate the move to a more egalitarian society is the central idea that my book is being built around. 

/// Panopticon_update

Continuing to work on 'decentralising the trust layer' with the NiftyPanopticon project, scaling the trust that we have built so far is proving to be a great challenge. Where blockchain collides with real world assets it is very difficult to keep things decentralised as legal indemnifications need to be built in to the system. The custodianship aspect of things is a large part of this problem; how do I prove something I sold as a digital representation of a rwa is still in my posession after it is sold?

/// 2021_update

Have been fortunate to corroborate on research in the NFT space and extrapolating what the next round of tokenisation will look like.

To that end I started a mission to evaluate the status of all the different token related EIP's found here; I posted on the Cat Herders Discord and in MolochDAO as it's loosely related to infrastructure and thought it may be worthy of exploration. Unfortunately I missed the community call that week but fortunately somebody took up the torch and is now running with it. Have been supporting the groups efforts by adding more specialist expertise where I can. 

Personally I would really like to see a token standard that includes a geo-loc element, that would open up a whole wave of innovation. Adding location would enable gamification and integration with the real world like we have never seen before. There are also benefits to proving location of a token holder like plausible avoidance of legal compliance obligations in the case of being labelled a security (increasingly problematic as people look to shard ERC721 tokens). 

Expanding the monetary base of Ethereum by bridging the physical world with the blockchain realm is my current focus area. There is a nascent effort to start doing this that involves transcribing legacy infrastructure on to the blockchain through registered companies and full compliance that seems to be a necessary evil. It's logical that bridging the metaverse with the real world should require a degree of integration. Projects like MKRDAO and initiatives to standardise tokenisation of real world assets like those coming out of Switzerland right now are of particular interest.

We successfully are able to swap between multiple chains such as ETH, TOMO, BSC, BCH, DOGE, WAVES, XRP, with BTC, LTC and more in the works. We intend to connect all blockchains with our technology. 

The solution we propose is the HY token. HY strives to be the token to bind them all, championing interoperability by granting the freedom to transact on and with any DLT. HY operates on a second-level token protocol that can transact units of account on a single ledger, or between a vast number of DLTs. Its transactions are stored on the DLT involved. This gives its users the advantage of using the ledger system that best suits one's needs.

Currently, we support over 380 different coins and tokens. We are blockchain agnostic and will continue to adapt new coins, tokens and blockchains. We believe in a diverse and plural crypto-ecosystem and want to support as many blockchains, coins and tokens as possible in our network.

The problem:
Many in our world ask why the production and innovation of the blockchain technology that supports the establishment of advanced industries in the Arab countries does not move despite its huge investments estimated at $ 2.4 trillion in industrial and emerging countries, according to estimates of the Arab League's Economic Unity Council. However, all of these investments have not succeeded in transferring and settling blockchain technology in any Arab country until now! Evidence for this is that there is no promising project or any other leading and high-tech Arab product globally.
The solution:
The reason for not investing is that Arab investors are unaware of this new technology. Consequently, our team considered creating a website that aims to introduce blockchain technology, especially the Ethereum ecosystem, as it is the most sophisticated and innovative.

the website
The site contains dozens of important articles that are interested in several areas, including the definition of blockchain technology, and how to obtain an ethereum portfolio ...
There are other articles interest to the gitcoin platform as it is the place where a very active community includes all people: developers, investors and ordinary people.
Why should you contribute?
If you want to be promoting blockchain technology in the Arab world and directing Arab developers to develop their projects in the field of digital currencies and blockchain. Because our project is based on explaining and translating educational and technical topics that will give an initial boost to Arab developers to develop the blockchain world.

4056,abundance-protocol-scaling-public-goods-1000x,"The purpose of our project is to create a viable economic model for funding and investing in public goods and digital content (open-source projects, scientific research, articles, videos, and so).


Benefits of the project include:
Promoting civil discourse online by allowing people to earn money for posting high-quality reliable content (and showing authors' credibility and track record) while penalizing dishonesty
Allowing investment in digital public goods, scientific research, open-source projects, investigative journalism.
Creates an alternative to the Ratings & Attention Economy, where content is valued on its credibility and importance - not ""likes"" or number of clicks.
All content is available for free, since the business model is not based on subscription or advertising.
Creating the ecosystem (and economic model) to allow massive growth in Open Source (read about our vision for Open Source)
Allowing content creators to profit when others build on or create derivatives of their work.

Through the Protocol users (Validators) will be able to review the credibility and relative importance (impact) of any online project (article, book, video, open-source, etc.) using a Proof-of-Value mechanism.

The Proof-of-Value mechanism works as follows: for any project, a Validator performs an initial validation to establish the expected Credibility & Importance Scores (CrS & IS) of the project, other review fields, and a self-review of the Scores of the Review itself (if a Validator is reviewing an online scam, for example, the scam can have a negative Score, but exposing it may have a high value for the ecosystem - thus the self-review will have a high Score). Initial Reviews are then sorted according to their Importance Score and additional Validators are assigned at random (to prevent collusion) to the most important Reviews (Projects with expected high CrS & IS are assigned more Validators since more expertise is required to assess the project).

For reviewed posts, Validators rate the credibility and relative importance of sentences within the post and provide sources to back their rating (reviewed sources with a high CrS further strengthen the rating), review the context of the post, categorize the post into various topics, and cite other projects that the reviewed post relies on (once the post is validated and receives tokens, the cited projects will receive a portion of the tokens based on how much these influenced the reviewed post). Each Validator's review will be weighted by their expertise in the topic(s) related to the reviewed post (defined by their CrS & IS in the topics). The content creator(s) will receive tokens based on the CrS and IS of their post from the review of validators (WEB Tokens = Credibility Score x Importance Score). These tokens are released over time, to minimize the possibility of users gaming the system (rate of release is faster with higher total expertise score of Validators). See full description of review mechanism in the project's White Paper.

Users will be able to request funding for their project (from other users in the ecosystem) in exchange for a portion of the expected value of the project - thus creating a sustainable business model for funding any type of digital content (public goods, open-source projects, scientific research and so on).

There are many aspects of the project that had to be resolved to create a functional system, including: creating an incentive structure that promotes accurate review of content; disincentivizing collusion attempts or other efforts to game the system; maintaining all the benefits of a system based on credibility while maximizing user privacy/anonymity (while disincentivizing sybil attacks); system economics, and so on.

1020,cashuwallet,"Cashu is an open-source multi-asset non-custodial mobile crypto wallet with some unique characteristics.

It works as a calculator, without a back-end. It uses public APIs and block explorers to gather balances, account history and broadcast transactions.

It is BIP-44 compatible. Furthermore, private keys are never stored on the device; they are generated on the spot for transaction signing (from a user-provided external password) and immediately discarded.

The app is built using a concise and helpful standalone crypto library, which could be borrowed by other open-source projects. It can be regarded as an executable documentation of the cryptographic choices and formats adopted by each of the supported assets, all in a single place.

It makes its best effort to provide the same functionality on Testnet for all supported assets. Therefore it can become a very useful crypto development tool.

I built Cashu for my own use. Like Bitcoin, it will always be open-source and will never become a commercial product, have ads, or other monetization tricks. The goal is to construct the most versatile, easy-to-use, cut-to-the-chase, privacy-conscious mobile wallet, that you can carry on your pocket like you would with your regular wallet.

This grant will help me improve and maintain the project:

1) Desired improvements efforts:

Port crypto library from Java to Rust (better cross-platform compatibility)
Support more targets and/or cross-platform (iOS, desktop, browser extension)
Support for new assets
Support stronger privacy with embedded Tor integration and wallet isolation via mixers
Support for Layer 2 (Web3 on Ethereum, LN on Bitcoin)
Support for decentralized exchange of assets (atomic swap, liquidity pools)
Support user-provided back-end replacement for public APIs and Explorers
Develop a commercial grade UX
Provide portfolio visualization
Re-brand
Write documentation and crypto library usage tutorial

2) Necessary maintenance efforts:

Keep compatibility with supported assets as they evolve
Update and replace integrations to known public APIs and block explorers

At the moment the app is not in its best shape and this is the reason I started this grant. I need to be able to allocate my time consistently to work on it.

Hi Guys.

Cryptouf here. I’m a French crypto lover. I mostly enjoy DeFi. On my website I’m trying to share what I learn and help people to discover and use new protocols.

For that I write guides, tutorials, news .. And what I enjoy the most is to speak about new projects I really like. Last round helps me to gain exposure and I met a lot of amazing people. I learned a lot, and I really hope I was then able to share it properly. 

I’m convinced communication is essential if we want to reach mass adoption….. And the French community is HUGE !

If you want to support a French blog about #Crypto and #DeFi , here you go !

But more importantly
I met incredible people and discover incredible projects. Some on Gitcoin and some contacted me afterward. So please do not hesitate!

How funds are used
Paid for the hosting of the website 
Paid for softwares
Paid a lot of gas, to make transactions in order to test protocols and be able to write content. Because, yes ! I like to try a protocol before writing an article or a tuto.

What’s Next ?
Create even more content.
Speak about new projects I like. And I really hope this round will allow me to discover amazing projects and be able to share it to the French community.
And basically continue to do what I’m doing !


Note that i'm also writing some content, mostly tutorial in English and created this Mirror profile.

Why Safient?

Have you ever wondered how will you recover or pass on your valuable crypto assets, secret instructions to your loved ones in case of an unfortunate event, or what happens when you no longer have access to your unsafe secret backup?
Worry no more, Safient protocol will help you securely manage all the critical information in a non-custodial way and help recover or inherit the assets so that your loved ones have access to them with 100 % surety at the right time, even in case of any tragic event.

What is Safient Protocol?

Safient itself is a secret recovery and inheritance protocol that can be used as a generic secret transfer mechanism. But we differentiate our protocol by focusing our efforts on building a secure and conveniently pluggable platform that could be easily integrated with services for the recovery and inheritance of digital assets. At Safient we believe that good security is the right balance between safety and convenience. And that's exactly what we strive to achieve - to make the self custody Safe and Convenient.


Our Solutions
We are here to solve the onboarding and inheritance problems of self-custody 🤗. So we are working on a few crypto-asset recovery and inheritance solutions in a non-custodial way.  Here are the solutions that are built on top of Safient Protocol to make that happen.

Safient Wallet: A non-custodial wallet that can be self recovered or claimed by beneficiaries at the right time without any intermediaries. We built this at ETHDenver 2022 and you can try the Alpha version of the application: https://wallet.safient.io. You may check out our demo video presented at ETHDenver.

Safient Safes:  Safient Safe is a non-custodial safe where you can store your crypto secrets/ instructions that can be securely and conveniently recovered or inherited at the right time by your beneficiaries. We are working on but reach us to know more about it and get early access: https://safient.io/safes

4092,citizen-crypto-corner-blueprint-to-occupy-empty-s,"There are tens of thousands of square meters of empty spaces in our cities and this will only increase with so many offices embracing remote work 💻

This is a great opportunity for citizens to use that space even if just temporarily. It's an opportunity to recreate new commons, new places where neighbors can meet, organize, co-create and learn together.

There is such an empty space in our street in Brussels, one thousand square meters, empty for years! So we negotiated to get the keys with the owner (story as a twitter thread) and we are now managing the space as a citizen collective. 

Our goal is to turn it into a DAO and extract a blueprint to enable citizens around the world to do the same. How to raise money? How to make sure that all citizens are invited to contribute? How to reward those contributions? How can we turn those new places in places where citizens can learn to become crypto citizens? We are learning by doing and we will share what we learn along the way.

Right now, we are organizing every first Wednesday of the month a Crypto Wednesday where local citizens can come and learn about crypto, get help to set up their first wallet, mint their first NFT, start playing a cryptogame, etc. And every Friday we do a crypto coworking.
Beside that, the space is open to other initiatives from the neighborhood. So you can also find yoga classes 🧘🏻‍♀️, roller disco 🛼💃🏼🕺🏻, ping pong 🏓, a trampoline, etc.

Virtual events are becoming a major thing and MetaCartel wants to lead the charge making them all-inclusive, sustainable, and freakin awesome 🤟🏼

A common misconception around the world is that ‘hacking’ specifically means coding or software development. This is simply not true! To prove it we’re inviting all hackers to join us on this quest! Whether you’re a designer, marketer, illustrator or hold any of a plethora of other skills we're opening this up for people to hack on projects and bounties from some of the most useful DApps on Ethereum. 

The goal of Dragon Quest is to rip the lid off the traditional hackathon framework, promote maximum collaboration, encourage cross-pollination of ideas and implementations, and more importantly to have the most FUN while doing it.
More concretely, the current state of global affairs makes in-person events difficult. Furthermore, there is a high barrier to entry for most conferences due to financial costs and visas. Virtual hackathons are cheaper, more inclusive, and more environmentally friendly. 

The Showdown 

Starting April 1st — and this ain’t no joke — we’re inviting you to Enter-the-Dragon for 30 days of distributed development kung-fu 🐉

100% of the organization of this event is driven, coordinated, and executed by volunteers. Your support will enable us to make the event accessible to a wider audience. This means reaching out to university students to help them hack on Ethereum, translating our articles, website, and promotional materials into Spanish, we've already started with Chinese http://dao2.io/720/ . By creating more evergreen content, workshops, and talks we hope to broaden the reach and impact of this remote first global event. 

The Loot 

Your funds will also go to the internal event coordinators who are doing essential work such as updating our hackathon website, coordinating community calls, writing blog posts / announcements / guides, and making sure everyone has all the information they need to make something awesome! 

Community is the superpower of the Ethereum Ecosystem. Having you're support will allow us to level-up the entire event, tap the potential of a wider community, and welcome many more people to join us in building the future of collaboration.

The protocol that makes it easy, fun and rewarding for people to live in harmony with the planet. 

Impact-2-Earn

If you make things simple and fun for people to use, they can do amazing things. 

It’s this motto that inspired us at Pozzle Planet. We realised that although people want to live sustainable lives, only 12% end up doing it (source: WEF). This is because living sustainably is often expensive, information about impact is not trustworthy, and there’s no strong social rewards system. Solving this requires building a tool that is easy and accessible for many people to use. In fact, the more people that used a tool like this, the larger it would grow, and in turn would generate more positive impact through its strong network effects. 

Due to this we decided to build the first 'impact-2-earn' social game via a mobile app where people can earn $POZ, a cryptocurrency that rewards you for joining activities that make a positive impact on the planet.



Image: Pozzle Planet Mobile App 


Enter Pozzle Planet 🌍

On the outside, a social game where people generate impact by sharing videos and earning rewards. 

Underneath the hood, an impact-Protocol and ReFi (DeFi) yield generator that passively farms people’s impact into tokens that contain other impact-generating assets - In Pozzle Planet, Staking $POZ = Impact².  

A new spin on Proof of Work, we only mine $POZ (our token) when value is generated (Proof of Impact). This helps usher in a new money lego that is impact driven, easy to value, trackable, and open to everyone in the world. 

To learn more, check out our Docs here. 

Taking the green pill 

Core to the Pozzle Planet ecosystem is the belief that through individual actions, no matter the size, we can create ripples that stretch across the universe. By enabling millions of users to benefit from generating impact-driven value through individual actions that are rewarded, we’ll be able to achieve our goal of creating a monetary system that is regenerative in nature, and grows via network effects. 

This is integral to what we’re building at Pozzle Planet. If you’ve made it this far, keep reading.  


Image: $POZ Tokenomics System

Here's what we're working on now

We’re hard at work with a founding team and core group of 20+ daily B2E contributors earning $POZ and collaborating on preparing the public launch of the $POZ token, the Pozzle Protocol and our cornerstone mobile-app to App Store & Google Play ultimo Q3 2022. 

In the past month, we’ve have 2x’d our Discord community and our members are engaged with our pre-launch activities, e.g testing our mining formula via pre- protocol $POZ mining, setting up partnerships through our Ambassador program+++ 

We have solidified our token and protocol design, build a new website with staking and bonding apps, build omnichain contracts on layer0 for the mint of our upcoming NFT series Pozzlenauts with in-app utility, made significant progress on the protocol development, and the mobile app will launch in alpha in June.  

Funds received through this funding round will be used to accelerate dev pace and remunerate contributors in delivering the mobile-app and smart contracts for the protocol.  

How it works in a nutshell

By the time you’ve finished reading this sentence you would have earned your first $POZ already. 

Here’s how: 

   1. Join a Planet Positive challenge
   2. Submit a <10 second video of you completing the challenge to add your Pozzle
   3. Earn $POZ

And on the backend, your tokens would be auto-staked to start earning passive yield that is 'impact-generating'. It’s really that simple. 

We look forward to your support! If you have any questions, please contact @ThomasBisballe thomas@pozzleplanet.com

This grant helps out a lot with new releases:
fixing lots of nasty bugs
implementing new features
revamping old ugly code
adding playable creatures
adding creature animations
add new combat locations
add new epic soundtracks

Even if you might not be into turn based strategy games (at first), you can think of this project as an universe (the reverse of Super Smash Bros. Brawl), since it has many original characters and creatures, which will be featured in many other games and animation projects (game being free open source), so this project will set its finger print all around (already does so). If you have a project, you can make use of the artwork or use any of the creatures. Heck, I even hope that the game engine could spawn forks with mechas and such at some point (how cool would that be?). At very least, Ancient Beast could inspire a whole lot of other projects in many ways (ideology, codewise, licensing, business strategy, pipeline, workflow, etc.).

213,metagame,"🐙 MetaGame tl;dr
At MetaGame, we believe things like Ethereum & DAOs are some of the basic infrastructure pieces for socioeconomic systems of the future.
We are bringing together people, knowledge, tools, building blocks & DAOs to build a new kind of society.
You can think of it as a real-life MMORPG with the goal of finding different ways to play life on a collective as well as personal level.
MetaGame is a massive online coordination game, in its baby form.
🤨 Why are we asking for funding?
Right now, pretty much everyone considers MetaGame as a hobby. It's hard to retain people for long when they’re being underpaid & it's hard to build anything fast if everyone is treating it as a side project. We are asking for funding to be able to guarantee paychecks to enable existing contributors to jump in full-time, hook in a bunch of new contributors and continue working on:
✅ Our first product: MyMeta & the minimum viable platform: MetaOS and make it adaptable and customizable for other projects as well
✅ Publish more educational content & podcast episodes
✅ Organize more events like this conference, hackathon, a festival & another festival
✅ Continue pioneering a DAO bootstrapping/accounting/payroll system
✅ Foster an awesome community & a small network of projects
✅ Help more people level up & break into the DAO ecosystem



🚨 What problems are we solving by doing all these?
coordination failures between people/projects/DAOs
tracking and rewarding everyone's contribution in a non-extractive way
overwhelming and complex onboarding processes in the DAO space
for people is difficult to get involved in web3
🌄 Our goals, in short:
Put our & other building blocks together into a coherent coordination-enabling UI
Help people solve problems & build a model of what crypto societies could be like 🙃

1252,polywrap,"Note to donors: we're not in a matching round anymore. Polywrap has recently closed a $1M pre-seed funding round. Polywrap is still a community-led project which uses a DAO to make decisions regarding its roadmap and the allocation of funds to its contributors. Financial backers have a minority stake in the current token supply (which is non-circulating, since the token is still non-transferable). We do appreciate that individual donors keep supporting the project and engage with us via our Gitcoin grant page, this is why we keep it active. However, we feel that it wouldn't be fair to receive part of the matching round that is primarily intended to fund public goods and self-funded projects. As a result, we asked our friends at Gitcoin to remove Polywrap from the CLR matching campaign.

The Power of Web3, The Ease of Web2
The Universal Integration Standard for Web3

Polywrap is a developer toolchain that brings the ease of Web2 to Web3. This project aims to make integrating Web3 protocols into your apps seamlessly, without sacrificing decentralization.

In addition, Polywrap is built with multi-platform support in mind. The Polywrap standard allows Web3 protocols to run on all types of devices in your favorite programming language (Rust, Javascript, Python, Go, C, C#, etc).

Our goal is to build a fluid and efficient environment that will bring Web2 developers and enterprises into the Web3 space. We are taking the one-dimensional and fragmented developer environment of Web3 and bringing standardization, composability, and multi-platform support. 

Here is a video explainer for the visual learners ;-)

Polywrap is an open source (MIT License) project. Your gitcoin donation will be transferred to and transparently managed by the Polywrap DAO.

[0x-Chan is the Decentralized, Open-Source, Waifu Representative of the Ethereum Blockchain]. 

This means we have a moral obligation to diversify and decentralize the design of 0x-Chan, so that the meme is a set of unique, decentralized, open source designs that are capable of interacting within a collaborative storytelling collective. 

I offer my humble services as an artist, and I've laid the foundation for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (#SEXPOP) so that we can make 0x-Chan Comics together, within a fluid community of artists, collectors, and collaborators. 

Only you can help 0x-Chan turn into a Meme made after your own image. 

What you get to gain: 
* Patrons and Gitcoin Backers will gain exclusive access to my monthly NSFW Comics. 
* Patrons will also be able to Vote. 
* Patrons will also have access to my exclusive Discord channel, where you can review the project logs of my previous projects. 

What can you do with 0x-Chan? 
* Design a unique character. 
* Claim Unique Ownership of that character via ERC-721 on the Ethereum Blockchain (SEXPOP). 
* Trade (Non-Fungible Tokens) with other collectors within the #SEXPOP Network. 
*Create your Own Projects - All Art Assets are Creative Commons INTL 4.0 
* Commission a 1-3 page Comic from myself or any other artist within the #SEXPOP Collective. 
* Share your designs by using them as memes, GIFs, avatars, making stickers, using them as art assets for your creative projects. 

Ownership is determined by 1/1 issuance of a Non-Fungible Token for that Character, which means that in the open-source, decentralized ecosystem, you will be responsible for HODLing your 0x-Chan, and sharing with the world. 

My objective is to build a structure / ecosystem that is larger than just myself, so that I can create value for people, and allow that value to have a life that exists outside of my own art. As far as I can tell, this is how collectives are born, because somebody has to create a platform, and then jump into the water, and then turn around and invite the others. 

This campaign is me taking a leap, and then turning around and saying ""Water's fine, who else wants to come in?""

2182,avogadro-online-scoring-system,"In the U.S., the ""Science Olympiad"" competition has been established to provide a space to encourage students to grow and learn in various STEM-related areas, with divisions for elementary, middle, and high school competition. Many states host Science Olympiad competitions, however hosting and organizing a competition is a significant project to host, and scoring the various distinct events accurately is a hard task to do manually.

Avogadro is an online scoring system designed to make hosting and scoring Science Olympiad competitions easier. Currently Avogadro is a paid service (to support the infrastructure costs of maintaining the server hardware for the service), but that can be limiting to smaller schools. At the high school level, student competitors can advance through regional competitions, to state-level competitions, and on to national-level competitions held annually. In the interest of wanting to encourage STEM learning as broadly as possible, and making the most amount of students able to have a shot at earning the national title, the Avogadro is applying for this round of GitCoin grants as a way to kickstart a different funding model, to remove the financial burden on the schools actually hosting Science Olympiad tournaments. Funds received through this grant program will go towards Avogadro development and infrastructure costs, and serve as ""scholarships"" for schools to use the Avogadro software for free to run Science Olympiad tournaments in their area. So, voting for this project will help funnel funds toward growing STEM-related education programs, and encouraging students to not just learn the basics, but hone their skills through academic competition as well!

Avogadro Scoring, LLC as a company has existed since 2009, and has served as the scoring platform for hundreds of Science Olympiad competitions, including state- and national-level competitions. Avogadro software has been used consistently across many different states, with great feedback on making the act of scoring, presenting, and organizing tournament data much easier. So, we know what challenges Olympiad tournament organizers face, and use that to make quality software. We have a reputation in the academic space we treasure, and hope this innovative means of fund-raising will help grow opportunities for students around the nation even more!

The Tao of DeSchool: reward retention and intention, and not just attention. Learning/teaching/working credentials should be about proof of curiosity and play.


Challenge
Learners, teachers, and employers have limited time and resources. They get tired of playing two different games - the traditional school/university/certificates/jobs game AND the emerging games that the internet has enabled. The vision of DeSchool is to play one unified, holistic, positive-sum game where everybody wins.

Parts of DeSchool are inspired by Ivan Illich's work on Deschooling society.

""A DeSchooled society would be a society in which everyone shall have the widest and freest possible choice to learn whatever he wants to learn, whether in school or in some altogether different way."" - John Holt


We're interested in building the base-layer educational infrastructure upon which a few affordances are built in:
Teachers are incentivized to share their expertise and teach well.
Students don't enter immeasurable debt for the privilege to learn.
Learning actions & outcomes are recorded on chain, creating a network of learning paths.
Shadow work by friends/peers/caretakers/parents in educating each other is accounted for.
Employers/DAOs are able to match these skills with available projects and people.

We believe in a few key things:
Education should be a public good.
Teachers should get paid because they are highly undervalued.
Students should get verifiable credentials they can resharpen and use for life.
Work is a natural extension of learning and happens throughout life. ""Learning on the job"" should be treated the same as learning in a university (and credentialized similarly).
Educational costs shouldn't be a major bottleneck for parents/caretakers/guardians in making life decisions.
Web3 and the state of internet tech makes alternative education/schooling feasible.

There are specific deliverables to start with which the grant would go towards:
mnemonic media (transformative tools for thought)
fostering conversations on emerging education (similar to Crypto Culture and Society)
non-transferable NFTs for necessary credentials
partnering with DAOs for education + employment programs (like a public goods school with the GitcoinDAO)
designing systems which incentivize learners, educators, and employers

842,dao-governed-eips-and-eth-20-spec,"Context

Hi there! we are working on The Underscore Protocol, a protocol inspired in GIT, but adapted to work with ideas instead of code.

The protocol is platform-agnostic and works with linked JSON objects that evolve similar to GIT repositories.

It can handle content from different platforms, including different blockchain networks. The integration with Ethereum is already done.

We also have a simple prototype of a content management app, similar to GitBook, but storing content on IPFS and governing it on Ethereum. We call this app ""Intercreativity"".

If you have metamask connected to rinkeby, you can check it out at https://eth.intercreativity.io.

What we will build with this grant

Our next milestone for Intercreativity is to have an Ethereum DAO governing the content in Intercreativity. 

Once ready, it can be used for storing and DAO governing community agreements such as EIPs or the ETH 2.0 spec.

Of course, it will also be available for any community that wants to decentralizedly store and govern any sort of evolving agreements and content. Think about social movements, expert DAOs or legal contracts.

We have already been working with DAOstack for some time now, and have some of the work needed to integrate their technology already done. 

The work needed to finalize this integration, and have a DAO governed Intercreativity space, is about 1 month of full-time dedication by an expert DAOstack developer, and it would require around 10k USD.

This would be enough to have a working prototype and start running some tests with the Ethereum community. To officially migrate out of Github, however, more work will most likely have to be done.

Intercreativity has big (as in super big) ambitions :)

Hello, I'm TokenBrice, I've been struck by DeFi's lights about four years ago and my main goal is now to spread understanding of the space to help its growth.

I initiated and still participate in several projects helping to spread awareness of DeFi, especially in French:

📖 Documenting & Supporting DeFi and NFTs:
I lead various initiatives to shine a light on DeFi and NFT, mainly:
📰 I share my research and insights frequently on my blog, written in both French, English and Spanish.
I contribute to various relevant projects for DeFi including Liquity, APWine (governance), Paladin (delegate), and a few others.

At a professional level, I contribute mostly to two key projects:
Under the aegis of Liquity, I support unstoppable DeFi: protocols enabled by immutable smart contracts that minimize third-party dependencies.
Through my contributions to Luchadores.io, I promote healthy standards for NFT-games: unstoppable NFTs (SVG), fair generation (ChainLink VRF), Play to Earn but not Pay to Win.

🇫🇷 DeFi France & Related:

🍕 I help to organize the DeFi France meetups and grow the community — 💬  We are now >3000 DeFians chatting daily on the DeFi France Discord (FR only).
📢 I also support the growth of the extended DeFi France ecosystem, with BanklessFR & TheDailyGweiFR.

You can follow my work on Twitter, or you'll find me at the events, hosting our weekly lives on my Twitch channel.

🎥 TokenBrice on Twitch
I started a new Twitch channel 100% dedicated to DeFi and fully in French. I host weekly shows to discuss the latest development both in the world of DeFi as well as for NFTs and collectibles.

I've been hosting the lives for almost a couple of years now. We hosted and chatted with top FR-speaking team members of the top DeFi projects such as Curve, Aave, and Sushi. > 30 NFTs were gifted overall to attentive listeners of the show, including Luchadores, Dizzy Dragons, Idols, and many others, as well as 10K USDC Pool Together delegation, amongst other goodies.

🌌 Zooming on TokenBrice.xyz
On my blog, every article is made available in French too. I designed tokenbrice.xyz's infrastructure to respect users privacy, collect a minimal amount of data, and provide transparency regarding the blog's updates. My blog is:

Entirely free, no sponsored or promoted posts, no source of fundings other than this Gitcoin grants
Privacy-conscious: no Google Analytics, absolutely minimal and privacy-aware analytics (details here)
Transparent: all edits are logged — I cannot update the blog without leaving a trace in the GitHub repo.

A guide helping to assess the resilience of DeFi protocols: Behind the scene of the decentralization theater: a study of the inalterability of DeFi protocols

✅ Since the last round
Many live shows in French discuss topics ranging from new DeFi protocols launching, key topics for DeFi, or even NFTs.
A dozen of deep-dive DeFi articles are available in French, English, and now even Spanish!

🤔 Why should I give?
All my contributions are made for the community: to preserve credible neutrality, I refuse all sponsorship or partnership opportunities. This Gitcoin grant is the only place where I accept donations to ensure they are always done in full transparency.

Donating is a way for you to show appreciation for my work if it was helpful while signalling its importance to others. Since I'm free of all commercial affiliation, I can discuss touchy DeFi topics like the risk structure of money markets, or the censurability of the whole DeFi space and provide informed unbiased contributions to the discussion.

Your contributions are welcomed if you appreciate my work and initiatives to raise awareness for DeFi.

Atstake also contains a marketplace for finding counterparties.

Atstake includes escrow but is more general: because it allows both people to stake money it can be used in many other cases as a lightweight replacement for the legal system. Disputes are resolved by an arbitrator who both parties agree to in advance. The arbitrator can be any ETH address.

Under the hood Atstake uses a 2-of-3 multisig system: two people among the counterparties and arbitrator have to agree before funds are moved. This means a single dishonest party can't cause an unfair outcome.

480,token-allowance-checker,"Control your approvals
Token Allowance Checker shows you all approvals for ERC20-compliant tokens, and the option to change the approved amount - or completely zero it.

The unlimited approval problem
Many DApps have the habit of requiring you to approve effectively unlimited amount of tokens. This helps improving the user experience, as you only have to sign off an approval once and it will be enough for all future transactions.

However this also means that the DApp (or the person/entity controlling it) can at any time transfer all of your tokens, without requiring any further approval. Imagine the owner of a Spender contract changes

In addition, there is no concept of expiring approvals. Once approved, the approval will remain forever. If you do not trust a DApp or its operators anymore, there is usually no easy way to remove the approval.

Token Allowance Checker is already live and running at https://tac.dappstar.io.


Grant goals
Allow to continue maintaining and extending TAC. Depending on the raised amount some tasks will be outsourced as bounties to speed up development.

Top priorities:

Extend functionality to cover NFTs (non-fungible tokens):
Non-fungible tokens (e.g. ERC721) have a concept of approval that is very similar to ERC20. You can allow a spender to spend an individual NFT or just allow to spend all NFTs you own. This concept bears the same issues and risks like the ERC20 approvals, so I want to add the NFT approvals to TAC.

Integrate DeFi score information:
Work together with the team behind https://inspect.codefi.network/ to add risk assessment info to spender contracts. This should help the user to evaluate if an approval is okay or should be changed

Add batch mode to change multiple allowances at once:
With the current implementation you need to perform one transaction for each approval change. It would be much better if you can select multiple allowance entries and clear them in just one transaction. Note that this is pretty much a research topic - at the moment I am not sure how this can be accomplished.

Add more/better ways to identify spender contracts:
Currently it is not always possible to identify who an approved spender is. Is it a DApp? A Dex? A wallet? The only hint available at the moment is the contract name retrieved from Etherscan API, which gets set by contract owner when (s)he verifies a contract on Etherscan. Not all contracts are verified on Etherscan, and sometimes the name alone is not very meaningful to the user. 
I don't have a detailed plan yet how to accomplish this task. But I'm thinking having a way to identify what entity a contract belongs to will be useful for many more use cases outside of TAC. So this could evolve into a sub-project on its own. Some food for thought on this topic:
Create some kind of decentralized contract metadata database/dapp? 
Create an EIP to have a community-wide standard way to store contract meta data information?
Leverage ENS reverse and text records?

Overall fixes and usability improvements:
There are a number of open issues in the github issue tracker that will improve the user experience. Examples:
Sort allowance list (https://github.com/TripleSpeeder/token-allowance-checker/issues/40)  -> Done!
Support ENS Names from url (https://github.com/TripleSpeeder/token-allowance-checker/issues/37)  -> Done!
Show timestamp of the last interaction with/of spender (https://github.com/TripleSpeeder/token-allowance-checker/issues/1)  -> Done!
Improve wallet handling (https://github.com/TripleSpeeder/token-allowance-checker/issues/28, https://github.com/TripleSpeeder/token-allowance-checker/issues/29)  -> Partly Done!
And many more :)

Change dfuse subscription to the ""Pro"" tier ($99/month):
Since there is no way to get a quick list of all allowances you ever created directly via web3 methods, TAC relies on the third-party service https://dfuse.io to get this information. They keep an index of the full ethereum blockchain that can be queried via GraphQL. 
At the moment TAC is running on their ""Free"" tier. The number of dfuse API requests is limited. Moving to the Pro tier substantially increases the limit and makes sure the site stays functional with increasing usage.

Patience is a virtue - wait until the full term of your deposit has passed and be rewarded. Withdraw early and be penalised. Those who stay invested get rewarded by those who withdraw early! Simple.


Users deposit their ERC20 token into a smart contract which pools these tokens with other users (pools only contain one type of ERC20 token - starting with the most popular such as Dai and WETH). If a user then withdraws their tokens before a set time has elapsed, then they incur a penalty fee. This penalty fee is set asied into a pot which is then shared with people who did not withdraw their tokens. The longer you keep your tokens in for, the better since you will be eligible to receive more penalties from those who withdraw before you. The penalty is accrued based on the amount deposited through a simple weighted average.

//demo vid.

Ideagogo is a platform similar to Indiegogo or Kickstarter.
Anybody in the world can post an idea to work on. (idea needs to be valid and be useful to the world, environment etc... moderators will delete fake or useless ideas) 
anybody else in the world can view these ideas and fund them multiple times with a very small amount of crypto. ($0.01 - $1)
//we are still working on the tokenomics.  how th e funding will happen, but as of right now anybody can fund any amount to any public idea.

 The person who started the idea can withdrawal funds when certain boundaries are met. Or moderators of the platform will unlock funds for the user when goals are met.


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
how you will interact with the dapp and publish an idea.
takes in a name and description (string, string)

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
to fund an existing idea simply choose the idea # found below the icon  (see img #3)
we want to be able directly by hovering over an idea instead of manually funding

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
this is how ideas published currently look. 
we will need to be update to bring a  more modern simple look

when u publish an idea, 
a image and the name and description get populated on the dapp.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
idea descriptions can be opened for more detail, initially we want the idea to pop up for more details
here we open up  (idea 3) self drone description button  to get a popup

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

all ideas are a NFTs 
this allows us to create ideas that can be owned by more then one person
the owner and funders will be able to own an idea.
idea creators get compensated for their work. funders get compensated for their contribution.

todo list:
moderators will need to decide on the proposed idea.
the funders will need a way to be rewarded after the project is successful or give dividends to funders.
UI update

//more todo
to create an idea you will need: active twitter page
website for demo and a small eth deposit that will be locked in the contract and sent back to yor account (so we dont have bots making fake ideas )
//
to run react app download files npm install then npm run
then it should load up a browser

Dear Friends (& Vitalik),
we are  github.com/Code-for-charity/youtube-extension
We serve 0.5+ million users and continously spent our free time on that since 2012 & started on Github recently. Now we are recommended by Firefox (permanently. Only 109 Projects).
      Users' productivity & happiness are the currency of our hearts.  
 Every $*** can create a new feature, never made or published before, that 10,000 smart people were waiting for already and millions would appreciate *if* they ever see it..	
This is our 1st priority. We reduce other jobs as much as financially possible.  
 Donators please voice your wishes and open source ideas. Can be easy or complex.

A. Our popular project yet is the original Youtube Add-On 'ImprovedTube' with 80+ unique features, to save time, ensure personal focus & convenience. Smart content filtering & history managing to come (https://github.com/code4charity/YouTube-Extension/issues/565#issuecomment-695357918 )
1 in ~2000 YouTube Users is with us yet (while YouTube has a billion times more money than us. Counting our work we would still operate 100,000s of times cheaper than YouTube and 100s of times per user)
Growing a few % per month, while YouTube is not growing anymore.
With no campaigning & despite extension ecosystems are neglected (completely unlike app stores, no standarized payments. nothing).	
Adblockers for Chrome are scheduled to lose some functionality January 1 2023   ('manifest v3', not affecting us, but we will research remedies.)
( For the average app, Google Play  processes several $1000 per year and Apple Appstore even 3 times more per app. Yet several top browser extensions rely one very few donations
Recently ~100,000 users surprise-joined us from the the 'crypto nation' South Korea(, which also has the highest percentage of crypto users)

B. We do a lot, but always envisioned a charitable crypto. We would love to make use of our talents & passion there and eventually present that to the world + to our existing users convincingly(, many who are techie (and design-sensitive) and who trust us since so long). 
     We should offer a bounty on every open Issue in our Github repos. 
Thus we should delegate work-load. Many simple ones (few complex missions) 
We make the code inviting to edit. There are some other developers who will help and are modest/poor even. (However we have no funding)
We can't work on half of the popular & meaningful wishes and that is sad. (And some of the work might never end as long as Youtube is updated😅)

C.  Funding will go a long, efficient way and also pay for our first campaign/s. You can make our work feel fully appreciated for the first time and help while it is the hard still.  (We didn't even publish a full documentation.)  
 Advertising Open Source, will help careless users to make better decisions.   
 A good app is worth a 5 minutes learning curve. 
market saturation for 'ImprovedTube' is far. (why not 1 in 10 YouTube Users?).  (While our success is earned / lasting, somebody also reached 0.x million  users recently, making something like a lite version with SEO, top features enabled by default  and copying some of our code). 
 In future our missions will also be eligible for public/gov. funding. We want to eventually become a global, social, full time employer. We also want to apply for free charity ads from google then. 
If crypto keeps attracting more users, then eventually enough users will have a browser wallet... (such as Metamask or Brave, then, for example $0.05/week micro-payments could be requested easily, (or as little as a user wants, then our extensions could finally self-sustain financially and kickstart so much more...)
Thank you & many smiles!
Questions?
UPDATE:  ROUND13: Thank you so much guys!! To get any signiticant grant here we will still need several donators until March24. Even if $0.01 each. (We understand crypto was much more popular in 2021 but this also means less competition).    
ROUND12: Awesome! the grant only went live for some hours and we received 10 donations.
Did any of you notice ImprovedTube before or try it by now?  (We applied early but unfortunately only were reviewed & accepted on the last day - now waiting for March)

4053,glosseta,"The Problem with Today's Web3

Presently, much of the attention around Web3 (i.e. the new internet backed by blockchains) is surrounded by misinformation and misrepresentation of what it is and what it isn't. The typical signals the average person is exposed to regarding Web3 casts a negative light instead of focusing on what the movement is trying to achieve. A lot has to do with a perception that Web3 and Cryptocurrency speculation are indistinguishable which is just not true. Web3 is the umbrella that covers the entire ecosystem and Cryptocurrency is one of the core innovations that falls under it.  Indeed, Web3 is more than just Cryptocurrency but the world doesn't hear or see that narrative. Much of the current narrative comes from mainstream media amplifying negativity around the space to spread FUD, celebrities taking advantage of their unknowing fans and in general people who frankly don't know what they're talking about. These are not the informational sources our friends and family should have to rely on to learn the space. We can do much better.

On the other side of the coin, regarding the reputable content that's out there, too much of today's documentation, educational oriented DAO's and communities are heavily developer-oriented. At this moment, that content is important for Web3s growth as developers are needed more than ever to ensure future building blocks are in place. Unfortunately, at this time no one is deeply concentrating on how the rest of the globe is supposed to understand Web3 and its surrounding ecosystem in a manner that doesn't require a technical background.  To add to the complexity of navigating the space, many of the prominent Web3 protocols, dApps, etc. have a hard time communicating their product to a non-technical audience and are missing a huge section of the population: the people who are going to be everyday users of their product.

Solution

Glosseta is on a mission to become the source of truth for factual Web3 content to become the goto educational platform to onboard the entire globe into Web3. While we might begin as a glossary, the north-star vision is to become the prominent open, localized and decentralized educational platform for anybody looking to onboard into the Web3 space regardless of technical background.  Initially, this will be driven through the creation of streamlined knowledge modules meant to introduce the fundamentals of Web3 to a broad audience. Further down the line, these will extend into knowledge modules for the broader Web3 ecosystem akin to decentralized (and incentivized) Wikipedia.

To make this a reality, this grant is looking to get the ball rolling on three main foundational pillars of the mission: The creation of the educational platform; the creation of a common decentralized data API and moderation protocol/mechanism to power the platform and the Web3 community around factual data; and uniting the entire Web3 community to come together to make this vision become reality. 

Proper, factual education at this stage of the Web3 movement is just as critical as the work developers are doing to ensure the fundamental pieces are in place for the next great wave of disruptive innovation. It is my hope to be able to partner with the great thinkers, developers and prominent entities of today's Web3 to be able to create the new world we are building that is accessible, transparent and comprehensible to the globe. Once we're united as a community then we can truly say WAGMI.

Thank you in advance for any support to help me establish a platform for the average Australian to access and be educated on the innovation and fairness of Fintech versus traditional banking methods.
""I want to help save embattled and struggling Aussie farmer's who are asset capable but cash poor from insolvency/bankruptcy or to provide capital for growth.""

By tokenizing their asset/s ""Land, Machinery or Infrastructure"", they can access liquidity from Investors for new projects or even restructuring debt simultaneously. The focus will be in giving investors the security of asset backed tokens but also the generation of returns either through real farming, asset appreciation and/or new revenue generation.
Projects could include clearing land, purchasing machinery, buying/selling livestock, expanding land acquisition etc.The Farmer never has to sell ""All"" of their land in an effort to beat bankruptcy or expand with further borrowing. The farmer can""buy back"" their assets later is also an option. 

I am a family sheep farmer,an IT Educator/MS Network Engineer and also an avid global economic ""market analyst"" with a passion for financial instruments that can be integrated into a less speculative and more secure market environment, attracting revenue growth vs debt reiteration.

I have up to 500 acres of our Family Land set aside for project 0. I also plan to extend smaller assets such as Machinery and Livestock. This is my vision and a journey I look forward to embarking on. I would appreciate any help going forward and creating a Project Team in the coming weeks for the skills I don't possess personally.

3810,the-spheres-of-babel,"  Inspired by [the library of babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/), here is that library reimagined in three dimensions. Encoded using [the Jellyfish (sunrise) Scheme]().

	Don’t we all live in our own bubbles? Each of us living a reality of our own. Some aligned, some not? Let us come together and outpouring these bubbles onto the chain so we may, as they say, ape! What’s more? Each non fungible sphere is dynamic in nature in that for absolute visibility, 1.0 opacity, a two way handshake is required. Hence ensuring privacy. What’s even more? Everything is projected onto a Bloch Sphere [read: 2D (complex) Riemann Sphere] and the only proof required while committing any activity is that ```(user)^2 + (network)^2 + (Zk-activity)^2 = 1```. As long as this is true, then by, ahem, _circular_, yet complex logic the activity is real, and who are you? Who are you to deny my intuitionistic understanding?

	To _ground_ the sphere in the multiverse of madness that we live in, the web3 tamagotchi lives in their own [damn] world, as described by their sphere (of babel). You may think of this as a feeble effort to utilize web3.0 to escape the 3 dimensions we are trapped in, whatever they may be (xyz, money lust greed, power fame control, theta-phi, space time existence, …). Hence, to understand this better we subject our poor tamagotchi to repeated dimensional traps and with empathy we break out of those traps in search of greater ones. Also, gives us something to do, don’t you think?

	A little of the math though because why not? Effectively it boils down to the set {0,1}, or if you bear with me, {e ** i.pi - 1, e ** i.pi}. Then everything else is effectively a factorial of this sole set, in that the 0 can turn into {..} or be stretched into a 1. This is also rather convenient for the binary world that our poor tamagotchis will be banished to. Simulating (hehe, get it?) a quantum environment, wherein the device is one quantum bit and you are the other and any commits on chain are the observed states, stored for as long as humanity can keep it together. Otherwise, the interaction between two entities on the network remains in superposition, unobserved, private, and secure. Of course requests are still allowed, but they may be denied for it may not be right time. Yet.

	But apart from telling tall tales, the hope of this project is also to pursue science and questioning just because; and with these spheres translated to STEM, discovery becomes a non fungible entity, with verifications using multitokens in an effort to task an external, democratic, neural center, so we may truly answer our deepest questions and, again, find newer, more exciting ones!! The dynamic aspect of the confirmation, especially as it relates to any specific sphere, allows all of us to embark on our own journeys towards the top of Maslow’s pyramid, using the best of humanity, as it relates to us, in pursuit of Dapp Ideas on these Quadrat1c Land5!

	Teeny bit more math, just quantifiers really. The idea is that either both the basic quantifiers are true or they are both false. The case where only one of them is true does not exist, and that becomes the zero-knowledge activity between two entities on the network. Socrates is mortal or immortal is only true when we know whether he is or isn’t. The mere existence of the `or` doesn’t imply truth. The consequence? Every function comes with a solution! Imagine that!!

Geon Network created the Geon app which enables users to get paid for visiting real-world locations. In the app, users search for nearby Geons. When they find one, they can interact with it to earn “Geon Coins” through a process called “geomining.”

The longer the user remains near a Geon, the more coins they receive. The geomined coins may then be exchanged for various types of rewards. This model lets organizations and businesses attract and maintain the attention of visitors or customers to a specific physical location, like a retail business, event, or anywhere they want people to be!

4051,oakland-privacy-strengthening-privacy-rights-infr,"Oakland Privacy was founded in 2013 as a citizens collective formed to oppose a Homeland Security-funded citywide surveillance gauntlet in the City of Oakland called the Domain Awareness Center (DAC). The DAC originated as a port security project in 2009, but by 2013 had morphed into a street level surveillance web that would have covered Oakland's flatland neighborhoods with license plate readers, gunshot detection microphones and cameras which would all be linked via mini-fusion center. The project had advanced quietly with little to no public knowledge or discussion. Oakland Privacy (then called the Occupy Oakland Privacy Working Group) galvanized Oakland's communities to ask questions about, and then to oppose the project, using public records requests, a close media collaboration with the East Bay Express, cultural organizing (including the infamous DAC paper mache rat), legislative advocacy and community organizing. Dozens of Oakland organizations signed on to oppose the project and several City Council meetings were essentially brought to a halt after 2-4 hours of public comments from hundreds of Oaklanders. In March of 2014, the project was essentially stalled pending a privacy policy to be created by an ad-hoc citizens commission (which eventually became the Privacy Advisory Commission, the first municipal privacy commission in the US), and then de-funded and ended. 

Oakland Privacy went on to co-create and implement a surveillance oversight framework that mandated usage policies, annual reporting and acquisition approvals and implement it in 7 Bay Area municipalities beginning with Santa Clara County in June of 2016. The framework has since spread to Oakland, Berkeley, San Francisco, BART along with Nashville, TN, Cambridge, MA and soon, San Diego and is under discussion in many more. Vallejo just voted to establish a citizen advisory board as well as San Diego, so soon there will be three of them in California. Under the framework, each municipality creates and models usage policies that center civil and human rights and racial equity. Oakland Privacy has achieved recognition for its work from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Protecting Civil Rights Award 2018), the Electronic Frontier Foundation (Pioneer Award 2019) and the Society of Professional Journalists (James Madison Award 2021). Ongoing work also focuses on public records and transparency, police militarization and the protection of the right to protest, sanctuary and immigration rights including ICE cooperation, surveillance vendors and commercial consumer privacy rights. Our volunteers are uniquely equipped with a deep web of relationships in the Bay Area from the grassroots to city officials, a record of legislative success and forged experience in creating and implementing groundbreaking frameworks and structures to rein in privacy abuses that most often target vulnerable communities. 

Much of our work since 2017 is chronicled on https://oaklandprivacy.org

Oakland Privacy is a fiercely independent collective, but we have worked in coalition with many community partners, large and small. We have from our very earliest days drawn on legislative and advocacy support from large organizations like the ACLU and EFF. In many cases, we have done the on the ground local implementation for shared policy goals. We participate and draw on their expertise for state wide and national legislative advocacy and bring our local hands-on work into the policy discussions to ground dialogue around what local cities and counties have done and are doing. For example, the passage of a military equipment regulation ordinance in Berkeley and in Oakland powered the state to pass  David Chiu's AB 481 this past year. Similiarly the adoption of local facial recognition bans in San Francisco and other cities powered state legislation by Assembly member Phil Ting to prevent its use on body cameras and federal legislation proposed by Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and Senator Ed Markey. In most cases, local work radiates to state and federal policymaking. We actively share our perspectives in Sacramento, sending position letters on dozens of privacy-related measures each year. 

We also cultivate local grassroots partnerships with small groups seeking to affect their cities actions. Recent examples include El Cerrito Progressives, Steven Taylor's family in San Leandro, Open Vallejo and the Vallejo Peace Project. Our goals in collaboration are to provide expertise in public records and surveillance usage policies, utilize our experience with lobbying elected officials to assist when it is helpful, and leverage media relationships for publicity. In many cases, we have brought in bigger organizations like the ACLU and EFF to lend their prestige to local struggles and lift up dialogue and advocacy occurring in smaller cities on the privacy and surveillance fights that are ubiquitous. 

Surveillance and privacy rights-abuses, as well demonstrated in numerous academic studies, do not impact all sectors of society equally. Some communities are the canaries in the coal mine. Among these groups: immigrants, Black people who are disproportionately criminalized, Muslims and other Asian religious minorities like Sikhs, less prosperous Asian communities like Cambodians, Pilipinos and Hmongs, the insecurely housed, trans communities, and protestors who use civil disobedience tactics. 

Vulnerable communities do not generally need to be told by us how they are impacted by police surveillance and ruthless corporate practices. But they do often want and solicit guidance about what fighting back against specific initiatives looks like and what options are available to rein in, regulate or oversee existing practices that are harming them. Abolitionist efforts are a long-term struggle and one we support as there are many aspects to the system that are irredeemable, but they often fall short in providing immediate and implementable strategies that can provide some protection and limit damage. That is where we attempt to work so that trauma and harm can be mitigated to allow longer-term struggles to continue. 

Oakland Privacy, as a volunteer collective, accepts some small donations and we sell t-shirts to meet petty expenses. In 2021, we are pleased to update that in June, Oakland Privacy was gifted with a $10,000 gift from a private individual in Kensington that was completely unsolicited. The donor asked that 90% of their funds focus on supporting advocacy towards banning or regulating facial recognition and automated license plate readers, so while the funds will support some of our ongoing activities, they will not be used for all of them. Similarly, in 2021, we also received our first grant, from the Rose Foundation Privacy Rights Fund, which is being utilized to fund part-time fellowships through 2023.

1158,finematics-defi-education,"Hi, it's Jakub here. Thank you for stopping by and considering supporting Finematics on Gitcoin.

I started Finematics in April 2018. The initial idea was quite simple - create whiteboard animations explaining different concepts across technology and finance. I started by creating videos on topics such as the Actor Model, Kafka and the Two General's Problem as at that time, I was working as a senior software engineer for one of the biggest brokerage companies in traditional finance.

Prior to this, in 2017, I got really interested in the cryptocurrency space. What brought me to crypto was its open and permissionless nature. This inspired me to start a new full-time position working as a software engineer for one of the biggest companies in crypto. This is also when I started introducing some crypto content to my channel including topics such as the Lightning Network and Bitcoin Halving. 

In early 2020, I discovered decentralized finance (DeFi) and fell in love with this space. I was already passionate about technology, blockchain, crypto and finance, so for me, DeFi was an ideal combination of all of that. I started pivoting my channel into more DeFi-related content starting with videos such as ""Smart Contracts Explained"", ""What is DeFi"", ""What are Liquidity Pools"" and ""What is Yield Farming"". 

Focusing on DeFi was a really good decision. In less than 3 months my channel grew from 2k to 14k subscribers, accumulating over 200k views and 20k hours of watched content. 

On 2nd December 2020 (Round 8), we were at 29,500 subscribers and around 650k total views.

On 10th March 2021 (Round 9), we were at 83,850 subscribers and around 1.7M total views.

On 15th June 2021 (Round 10), we were at 173,750 subscribers and around 3.7M total views.

On 8th September 2021 (Round 11), we were at 220,000 subscribers and around 4.65M total views.

On 1st December 2021 (Round 12), we were at 270,000 subscribers and around 5.8M total views.

On 9th March 2022 (Round 13, we were at 314,000 subscribers and around 6.8M total views.

On 8th June 2022, we are at 330,000 subscribers and around 7.4M total views. 

For me, DeFi is one of the most interesting and fastest-growing movements with an amazing potential to completely disrupt traditional finance. Although I believe DeFi is the future, it can be quite difficult for newcomers as it combines a lot of elements from two poorly understood subjects: finance and technology. I'd like Finematics to be a go-to source of free information about DeFi.

Here is an example of one of my videos on DeFi:

Besides DeFi, I also realised how important it is to explain the underlying technology. That's why I started creating videos on topics such as Ethereum 2.0, EIP-1559 and Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions. 

Here is our video about rollups:

On top of this, Finematics started covering other related elements in crypto and web3 including NFTs. 

Here is our video about NFTs:


I love the idea of being sponsored by the community and I'd like Finematics to always remain an unbiased source of free education. 

In Round 7 I used some of the extra funds for customised graphics, for example:


Thanks to Round 9 I was able to buy a new microphone that significantly improved the audio quality.

I'd like to use funds from Round 14 for:
adding more languages (both voiceovers and subtitles) 
create more coding tutorials focusing on DeFi
more SVG graphics (currently I'm limited by what is available in my software, a set of customised graphics costs around $50-$100, I'd like to get a designer to work with me on some DeFi specific graphics - this is an ongoing effort started in the previous round)
drawing software subscription
hiring someone to help with audio cleanup and animations  

If you got this far, thank you again for considering supporting Finematics on Gitcoin.

Access to technology throughout human history has created enormous economic and social inequality globally. The blockchain and crypto-currency industry is not lagging behind, as major innovations in this ecosystem generally exclude a large part of the world's people.

Information and development on decentralized technologies is usually in English. And yet, Spanish is the second language with more native speakers in the world, If previous change is made then maybe ""surpassing it."".  This imbalance inspires us to join efforts to create inclusive tools for the Hispanic community and the rest of the world.

EmpanaDAO is the first decentralized autonomous organization created by Latin American entrepreneurs that designs, develops, tests, audits and governs decentralized protocols and applications, based on web3 technology. It also produces, translates and delivers educational content that will enable Latin and Caribbean people to enter this sector.

The immutability and resistance to censorship of web3 technology are the main benefits brought to us by the different blockchain protocols, and they give us the possibility to raise our socio-economic and cultural level. Among the experiments projected for EmpanaDAO, we include forming organizations and applications that safeguard value and trust without the need for intermediaries.

The main goal of EmpanaDAO is the global collaboration with projects that promote new financial systems where Latin America is an integral part. Likewise, we seek to merge the Latin American intellectual and cultural richness in order to carry out new projects that will help highlighting the presence of Spanish-speaking talent in the decentralized technology industry.

The 2020 pandemic demonstrated the need for change in governance systems. The emergency exposed the fragility of our economic system and our society's global leadership, reinforcing the importance of self-sustaining communities in problem solving.

Our organization will create a decentralized and autonomous ecosystem that is a reference in Latin America. Join the creation of this community, where we promote technological entrepreneurship with a Latin flavor!

""After a hard day's work, there's nothing that brings you back to an afternoon with friends, a warm home and the richness of Latino culture like a dozen empanadas.""


 ""Spanish Version""  

Manifesto


El acceso a la tecnología a lo largo de la historia de la humanidad ha creado globalmente una enorme desigualdad a nivel económico y social. La industria del blockchain y criptomonedas no se queda atrás, ya que las grandes innovaciones en este ecosistema por lo general excluyen a gran parte de las personas a nivel global.

La información y desarrollo sobre tecnologías descentralizadas usualmente es en inglés. El español es el segundo idioma con más hablantes nativos en el mundo, sobrepasando al inglés. Este desbalance nos inspira a unir esfuerzos para crear herramientas incluyentes para la comunidad hispana y el resto del mundo.

EmpanaDAO es la primera organización digital autónoma creada por emprendedores latinoamericanos que diseña, desarrolla, prueba, audita y gobierna protocolos y aplicaciones descentralizadas, basadas en tecnología web3. De igual manera, se encarga de producir, traducir e impartir contenido de educación que permitirá a latinos y caribeños entrar a este sector.

La inmutabilidad y la resistencia a la censura de la tecnología web3 son los principales beneficios que nos traen los diferentes protocolos blockchain y que nos brindan la posibilidad de elevar nuestro nivel socio-económico y cultural. Entre los experimentos proyectados para EmpanaDAO, incluimos formar organizaciones y aplicaciones que resguarden valor y confianza sin la necesidad de intermediarios.

La meta principal de EmpanaDAO es la colaboración global con proyectos que impulsen nuevos sistemas financieros donde Latinoamérica sea parte integral.

Asimismo, buscamos unir la riqueza intelectual y cultural latinoamericana para sacar adelante nuevos proyectos que ayuden a marcar la presencia del talento hispanohablante en la industria de tecnologías descentralizadas.

La pandemia de 2020 demostró la necesidad de un cambio en los sistemas de gobernanza. La emergencia expuso la fragilidad de la economía y el liderazgo sobre la sociedad a nivel mundial, reforzando la importancia de las comunidades autosostenibles para la solución de problemas.

Nuestra organización creará un ecosistema descentralizado y autónomo referente en Latinoamérica. ¡Únete a la creación de esta comunidad, donde impulsamos el emprendimiento tecnológico con sabor latino!

“Luego de una fuerte jornada laboral, no hay nada que te regrese a una tarde con amigos, un cálido hogar y a la riqueza cultural latina como una docena de empanadas.""

Hold the government of Canada accountable. 

Feel like the Canadian government isn't doing enough to safe guard us from climate change? Want to find a way to hold them accountable? Here's your opportunity. These two legal and campaign challenges have standing where others do not.

This fund was established to direct support to Indigenous activists working on the front lines of fights against the Trans Mountain Pipeline ""expansion"" project (TMX) as well as legal battles to hold the Canadian government accountable for their actions on climate change. 

Update: In the last three months funds have been distributed in support of the Tiny House Warriors for their legal defence and in support of Rueben George and his family. Rueben has actively travelling In Wet'suwet'en territory Camp 44 as well as other location along the coast in support of acitivism and healing.



On the legal front over the next 3 months 'We Stand Together', an organization formed to craft legal challenges to government decisions on climate will be gathering additional Indigenous allies in support of a First Nations legal challenge and formulating a highly strategic legal and public campaign to amplify Indigenous voices before the courts including: targeted media,education and public engagement work.

On the TMX pipeline fight over the next 3 months efforts will be ongoing to continue to build the international coalition that opposes this project. We will continue to support Indigenous communities and allies defending their land, water and community members.



The TMX pipeline fight has been ongoing for over 10 years. First Nations and allies have pushed the project back time after time in the courts and at the ballot box. Eventually Kinder Morgan backed away from the project and then the government of Canada stepped in and bought the pipeline for over 4 billion dollars and then reapplied for permits... from themselves after the permits were revoked in court. The cost of purchase and construction is now estimated at well over 12 billion and the project would mean massive and ongoing increases (instead of decreases) to the amount of carbon intensive tar sands oil extracted, and exported via oil tankers and then burned every year. This means huge risks for local people and ecosystems and its a big step in the wrong direction for the climate. There are better alternatives for how this money could be allocated and the project has never had the consent of the First Nations and other community members living along the pipeline and tanker route.

First Nations activists have been leading the opposition to this project and many more around the world. It has been our honor to work in their support. If you would like to join us in supporting These activists in their ongoing fight donate here. We will post updates about the campaign and how the funds were distributed on the Beyond Fossil Fuels Campaign twitter account @BFF_Campaign
 
 “For decades, the government's actions and inactions have been a dominant factor in climate change and have violated the unceded rights of First Nations. At 'We stand Together', we believe we have strong legal grounds to challenge the federal/provincial government to uphold their fiduciary responsibility to First Nations peoples and protect the health of the next seven times seven generations.""

 

We are establishing a legal climate case that is aimed at ensuring systemic climate planning and remedies for legally binding, science-based climate recovery policies.
 
As Canada continues to wrestle with what reconciliation with Indigenous peoples means, Indigenous Nations have been pushing both human rights laws and the laws of nature to the forefront with persuasive court cases that have stopped many, large industrial projects from not only destroying their traditional lands but the rights of us all of us for a healthy planet.

Leading these actions are:
 
Brenda Sayers and the Hupacasath First Nation, perhaps best known for challenging the Canada-China Foreign Investment Protection Agreement (CC-FIPA) in court, has stepped forward to once again champion a legal strategy that will help Indigenous peoples use their rights to take action on climate change.

All cryptocurrency raised in this fund will go promoting and supporting these campaigns. Elephant in the Room Climate Communications will also work in support of these campaigns. In the future this fund could be expanded wider to other campaigns if there is support from the web3 community.

696,sum-covid-solidarity-crowdsourcing-for-medical-su,"As we face the impending meltdown of public (and private) health infrastructure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of independent projects are emerging and struggling to make a difference.

This grant campaign aims to help fund 3 projects, each tackling different angles of critical public health COVID-19 response: medical supplies, mental health and food support.

1. @MakersContraCovid is an autonomous group of volunteers who mobilized the prototyping of 3d printed faceshields for healthcare professionals. We recently validated a new 3d model (better fit for ICU procedures), released it here, and now preparing mass production with injection mold. Hundreds of faceshields are being delivered to hospitals all over Brazil and the 3d files can be used worldwide.

2. Liberadores is an international platform to help connect vulnerable people (like healthcare volunteers and prejudiced minorities) with professional therapists for emergency psychological care. Developed by activists, for portuguese and spanish speakers, with sessions both free and for symbolic fees.

3. Vegg@Home is an international food experience platform focused on supporting affected food businesses such as small street food businesses, restaurants and cafes. The platform offers them options for food delivery, food collection (pick-up) and free food for vulnerable groups, besides donating resources to NGOs and other projects. We are currently a member of the CFS - Committee on World Food Security - UN.

Funds will be split evenly between them (minus fees) and receipts will be posted both here and in a future gitbook for open accountability.

I am Pedro Parrachia, passionate about the underlying structures of collective direct action for the common good. Contributor to the 3 projects presented here, member of DAOincubator, ECSA and Rhizom (and Origem, Rhizom’s own response to the pandemic), and contributed to a number of other Web3 projects such as Faircoop, GenesisDAO and Blockchain Research Network.

864,dutch-swap-digital-dutch-auctions-for-everyone,"Dutch Auctions Are Fair!

Not one of the lucky $FEW?
You ever wondered how to get into a private round?
What about being last in a bonding curve?
Were you asleep when a ""Fair Launch"" went live?

It has never been clearer. 
We need, new fairer way for fundraising new projects. 
A way that doesnt favor whales, arb-bots or citadels of VCs and influencers.

The question is, How would you do it?

What about an ICO, ever wonder how the founder ""picked"" 10c per token? Why not 12c or 20c? 
And the private sale at 0.1c, whats that about? 
Or the first person to list on Uniswap, how did they pick $200 per token? 

Or.. say you wanted to sell collectables, what would you charge? 
If they sold out instantly, you under charged,. DAMMN now they are trading 10x on Opensea? 

All of this is money for new project that go to arb bots and whales. 


Dutch auctions are awesome!

Dutch auctions solves the price discovery problem, fairly. 
Best is, there is no rush to buy at the start.
They remove the time pressure to get in before they sell out.

Gnosis used them to raise thousands of ETH, so did Google in their 2004 IPO, the Fed Treasury used them to issue new money pricing bond auctions, and ofcourse, the Dutch, every week for hundreds of years, selling billions of dollars in flowers via Dutch Auctions in Holland. 

So, why not more of us within the Ethereum Community?

What is a dutch auction?

A dutch auction starts with a batch of tokens (say 100 TULIPS) and I have to sell all of the tulips at the end of the week. ('cause they're flowers) 
I start with a high price, 10 DAI per tulip, and drop the price bit by bit. I sell a few flowers at 7 dai, some more at 5, 4, most at 3 and sell out at 2.5 DAI. 
Now the cool part is.. Everyone pays the same fair price, the lowest price.. 2.5 DAI!!

Why are dutch auctions important to all of us?

They have a number of use cases besides just crowdsales, and as a signaling tool. 

Initial DEX Offering pricing
Proposal weightings in DAO governance 
Fair way to pick new DAO members
Token weightings in liquid democracy, 
Price discovery for option premiums,
MKR liquidation auctions
hatching a commons.. and 
selling 1000 tulips, if you really wanted.


What I plan to build.

Open sourced smart contract factory for dutch auctions.
Let anyone create a dutch auction to sell batches of ERC20 tokens
Batch payments in either ETH or an ERC20 of your choice. 
Pre-order queuing for super popular auctions

I've be working here - https://github.com/Deepyr/DutchSwap
I plan to make a simple DApp so you can deploy your own dutch auction contract.

Please help make DutchSwap a reality!

Add to cart and Donate 1 DAI today! :)


UPDATE:

Since our last Gitcoin grant, we're happy to share we have finished the auction factory and already have someone using our dutch auction contracts.
Our frontend is built and we're going through some gas optimizations and state based contract testing using Brownie!
Auction Factory is deployed on Ropsten, Rinkeby, Kovan and Goerli testnets and plan to go on mainnet when Bokky or Andre gives the mainnet thumbs up.

We hope to go mainnet sooner with your help. 
Please vote for us with 1 DAI today and help us get our contracts in front of more developers.
There is alot I still would love to build to make it better, like token vaults, vesting and refunds. 
Our hope is to get more projects to fundraise fairly and earn trust via a DutchSwap auction.

Each repository is completely autonomous and can be added to a host relational database and/or removed from it, at any time, without affecting other repositories. Repositories can have references to each other thus depending on data that other repository contains, but must be usable without referenced repositories (thus being both interdependent and autonomous).
Initial AIRport deployments will have server components to enable communication between mobile devices.

library linking at time of deployment.
deterministic deployment across networks.
support for specific deploy script per network (L1 vs L2 for example)
deployment dependency system (allowing you to only deploy what is needed).
deployment retrying (by saving pending tx): so you can feel confident when making a deployment that you can always recover.
deployments as test fixture using evm_snapshot to speed up testing.
ability to create your own test fixture that automatically benefits from evm_snapshot's tests speed-up boost
combined with hardhat-deploy-ethers it has the ability to get ethers contract instance by name (like await ethers.getContract(""ContractName"")).
importing artifact from external sources (like npm packages), including truffle support.
importing deployments from external sources (like npm packages), including truffle support.
ability to log information in deploy mode only (while in test the console remains clean).
contains helpers to read and execute transaction on deployed contract referring to them by name.
These helpers contains options to auto mine on dev network (to speed up test deployments).
save metadata of deployed contract so they can always be fully verified, via sourcify or etherscan.
ability to submit contract source to etherscan and sourcify for verification at any time. (Because hardhat-deploy will save all the necessary info, it can be executed at any time.)
support harhdat's fork feature so deployment can be accessed even when run through fork.
named accounts are automatically impersonnated too, so you can perform tx as if you had their private.
proxy deployment with ability to upgrade them transparently, only if code changes.
this include support for openzeppelin transparent proxies
diamond deployment with facets, allowing you to focus on what the new version will be. It will generate the diamondCut necessary to reach the new state.
watch and deploy: hardhat-deploy can watch both your deploy script and contract code and redeploy on changes.
HCR (Hot Contract Replacement): the watch feature combined with proxy or diamond, gives you an experience akin to frontend Hot Module Replacement: once your contract changes, the deployment is executed and your contract retains the same address and same state, allowing you to tweak your contracts while debugging your front-end.

Gaming will drive adoption and onboarding in the blockchain space. Successful games will not copy web 2.0 games, but reinvent new mechanics that utilize web 3.0 strengths. Games should also emulate other concepts in the ecosystem to give us a sandbox to explore. 2019 is the year of the DAO. A decentralized autonomous organization game will empower a group of players to employ governance tactics to work together or compete to accomplish a goal.

Introduction
DAOG will have a nostalgic feeling of early browser-based resource management and strategy games. At first I’m going to use emojis to represent items on the game board. The gameplay will consist of phases, the first of which is open world map building. The game mechanics and victory conditions will be very open ended. It will start with a minimum scaffolding and players will vote in new pieces.

How does the game work?
A simplified version of how the game would work is available in the project link below

https://forum.poa.network/t/daog-an-open-ended-decentralized-governance-game/2599

Goal
This idea is still early and changing rapidly as I lay out the contracts. The goal is to test out both new game mechanics and decentralized governance techniques in a way where there is skin in the game, but it’s still a game. I want it to be incredibly extensible and open to anyone to create, add, and financially benefit from.

821,umbra-privacy-preserving-stealth-payments,"What is Umbra?

As a protocol, Umbra defines a simple set of standards, coupled with a singleton smart contract instance, to enable stealth addresses on Ethereum. With a stealth address, a payer can send Ether or ERC20 tokens to an address controlled by the receiver, but no one except the two parties know who that receiver is. 

On chain, the transaction looks like a simple transfer to an otherwise unused address on the Ethereum network. Off chain, the sender has used a public key published by the receiver to generate the new address. By encrypting the data used to generate the address, and announcing it via the Umbra smart contract, the sender can let the receiver know they’ve sent them a payment to a new stealth address. Only the receiver can generate the private key needed to withdraw the funds.

By leveraging meta-transactions Umbra enables withdrawers to pay relayers for gas using the tokens they’ve received. This avoids the need to fund stealth addresses with Ether before withdrawing.

What is the project's status?

The Umbra MVP went live on mainnet one year ago, in June 2021. You can visit https://app.umbra.cash to send and receive stealth payments using Umbra.

Since our launch, we've made many iterative improvements based on user feedback. These included better mobile responsiveness, a simpler key registry system, faster scanning when searching for received funds, and other UX enhancements. We've also launched Umbra on Polygon, Optimism, and Umbra, and made huge improvements to our relay system to make token withdrawals faster and cheaper.

Since launch, Umbra has processed more than 45,000 transactions across all networks. More than 23,000 accounts have registered stealth keys to enable privacy preserving payments through Umbra. Despite this growth, Umbra remains a grant funded public good project made possible by the community.

Why do we need your help?

We are grateful to our many supporters who have enabled us to get this far. There's still lot's more work to do!

We believe there is so much more we can do to make Umbra an even more powerful privacy tool in the Ethereum ecosystem. Here are just a few areas of development we're hoping to fund with your support.

Withdrawal Integrations

Reaping the privacy benefits of stealth addresses requires good hygiene when moving funds out of the stealth address that received the funds.

Umbra already has some affordances for making this easier, such as gasless token withdrawals via meta transactions. Through post withdrawal integrations, we can make privacy hygiene seamless for Umbra users.

The highest priority integration is with Tornado Cash. It would allow users to receive a payment at an Umbra stealth address and move the funds directly into the Tornado Cash mixer. Later, withdrawal the funds from Tornado to the address of your choice.

Layer 2 / Sidechain Deployments

Umbra is useful for payments, but smaller payments have been largely priced out of mainnet by high gas fees. Luckily, Umbra can work well across any L2 or sidechain that is EVM compatible. Umbra is now live on Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum. We're looking at other potential deployment targets, and hoping to expand the usefulness of Umbra on the networks where it already exists. This includes expanding the tokens available on these networks, and implementing integrations on these networks as well.

UX Improvements

We’ve been collecting feedback from beta testers and early users, and see some opportunities for UX wins. We've already executed on some of these improvements in the last few months, but there are many more to tackle.

Advantages of Umbra

Umbra allows arbitrary amounts to be sent, since there is no need for inputs and outputs to be uniform.
Umbra does not require the receiver to wait to withdraw funds— as soon as they're sent, they can be withdrawn to any address the receiver chooses.
Umbra ensures only the receiver can withdraw the funds once they're sent. The sender does not hold the private key of the receiving address.
Umbra uses significantly less gas, as it does not require the verification of any advanced cryptography on chain. All transactions are simple transfers.
Umbra enables ETH and arbitrary ERC20 tokens to be transferred privately. You're not dependent on a large anonymity set developing for each token.

Sample Use Case

Alice owns a business and hires Bob to subcontract for her. She agrees to pay Bob 1,000 Dai/week for his work.

The first time Bob visits the Umbra app, he sets up his account, enabling hime to be paid privately. Alice uses Umbra to send 1,000 Dai to Bob each week— she only needs to know his ENS name or address.

On chain, we see Alice pays 1,000 Dai to a different and otherwise empty address each week. Behind the scenes, Bob controls the keys to each of these addresses via Umbra, but nobody else knows as much.

Bob uses Umbra to withdraw his 1,000 Dai each week. He only needs to provide an address. Obviously, it's best for him to use an address that's not tied to his identity. He usually chooses to send it straight to an exchange, where he sells it for fiat as needed.

Because Umbra uses meta-transactions, Bob doesn't have to fund the stealth address with Ether to withdraw his Dai. He can pay a relayer for gas with the Dai itself.

How Does it Work?

Below is a high level description of how Umbra works:

When setting up your Umbra account, users sign a message. The hash of this message is used to generate two private keys—a ""spending key"" and a ""viewing key"".
The corresponding public keys are both published on-chain in Umbra's Stealth Key Registry contract.
A payer uses your the Umbra Registry to look up your two public keys. Separately, the payer generates a random number.
The random number is used with the spending public key to generate a ""stealth address"" where funds are sent. The same random number is used with the viewing public key to encrypt the random number.
Using the Umbra contract, the payer sends funds to the stealth address and the encrypted data is emitted as an Announcement event.
The receiver scans all Announcement events from the Umbra contract. For each, they use their viewing private key to decrypt the random number, then multiply that number by their spending private key to generate the stealth private key. If the stealth private key controls the address funds were sent to, this payment was for the receiver
The receiver can now use the private key to either directly send the transaction required to withdraw funds to another address, or sign a meta-transaction to have the withdrawal request processed by a relayer.

This Grant

We have transcribed this dream into a document we call the 'Golden Dream'

Our plan is to continue breathing life into this document, transforming it to a Living charter, the visible spine of our our platforms governance, 
Allowing our community to propose and ratify amendments with cryptographic signatures. 
You may read , yOur Golden Dream or Download from IPFS 
We printed the first public version of the document in 2018, and hashed it on the bitcoin blockchain on 5th Nov, we updated it with a second version 6th November 2019. 
This Year we are revising and hashing the document on the 7th of each month. 

This grant is therefore to continue the evolution of the Golden Dream as a document steering the manifestation of this dream into our shared reality. Exploring the most sustainable and unique way to print and present yOur Golden Dream using ancient crafts and modern technology as it grows. 
As well as developing the ability to cryptographically sign a charter, 'yOur Golden Charter' at the end of this document. This charter will focus the governance of proposing and ratifying amendments to the dream, and serve as a technological template for other charters (local and global) the S33D ecosystem might require.

More On S33D 

S33D is a marriage between the ancient and modern worlds. 

Weaving a distributed seed & story library, around a network of community Pods that will anchor the recalibration of our systems around the value of local & global community saving, heart centred sharing of stories, traditional crafts and organic provenance trails. 

We are creating this living sm(art) canvas of ancient DNA and encoding it with cryptographic precision by…

Mapping 

By hashing and storing seed flows, tree distribution, and harvest cycles across distributed ledgers. 
Offering wider and more transparent access to a diversity of food, medicines, plant based products, as well as their orbiting data.
We seek to map every element of our supply chain, and the systems that service it. 

Feeding

Freedom with Creative consumption.
By revaluing the role biodiversity has to play within both our local and global value flows, S33D begins to unlock the full potential of organic assets whilst protecting the seeds of sovereignty. 
Focusing innovation around local, open-source libraries and gardens, S33D opens up a playground of edible education. Empowering us to see the creation inherent in our consumption, we remember we can feed the future world we wish to live in, while feeding ourselves. 

Securing

Data sovereignty for nature and knowledge. 
The SLN (S33D’s Library Network) is harnessing a growing suit of tools to assist us in reconnecting with our sovereign origins through education, trade, and localised community curation.

“Diversity goes hand in with decentralisation, and the creation of decentralised, biodiverse food systems is the key to the design of a world without hunger. For this, a shift from globalisation to localisation is vital. Globalisation has reduced food to a commodity while expanding the control of agribusiness. Localisation reclaims food as nourishment, expands community control of food systems, and promotes food democracy and food sovereignty.” Vandana Shiva

1160,democratized-controls-architecture-for-the-develo,"Main Idea

Cooper Hyperloop, Hyperloop IITB, Strathloop, and HyperXite are student hyperloop teams looking for a minimum of 5000 DAI in funding in order to build a shared, hyperloop controls infrastructure. This would create a standard for the industry and make it much easier and faster for newer research organizations to work on more pressing hyperloop problems. The Hard Tech Fund is looking to help manage this project; they ran an open research symposium for hyperloop symposium at the end of last month (https://www.hardtechfund.com/hyperloop.html) and are committed to a mission of transparent hyperloop development worldwide. Would you be interested in donating to this effort to help expand high speed, renewable transportation? 

Introduction 
Hyperloop is a transportation concept based on the idea of having a vacuum chamber that is used as the medium of transfer for a set of pods, each fitting 5 to 80 people ideally. The idea was first proposed back in 2013 with the advent of Elon Musk’s “Hyperloop Alpha” whitepaper, though it has existed in popular culture ever since the large scale use of pneumatic tubing in the late 1900s.

Yet, even nearly a decade after the writing of Elon Musk’s whitepaper, numerous feasibility studies, and a multitude of student and professional teams building hyperloop pod designs and structures for both the SpaceX Hyperloop Competition and infrastructural development around the world, there does not yet exist a standard controls system architecture for use across all hyperloop pods, forcing teams to spend thousands of dollars and, more importantly, thousands of hours to develop their own. 

Why is this a problem?
Hyperloop’s key usage is as a method of transportation for people, followed by a method of transportation for freight. For either existing infrastructural systems, a coherent, standardized set of controls architecture already exists; the automotive industry has the CANbus standard, and the railway industry has a standard set of coupler linkages per country they operate in. Not only does this standardization ensure that all controls systems lead to safe and secure applications, but they ensure that small companies and large companies alike can operate hyperloop pods on the same underlying infrastructure without fault.

The SpaceX Hyperloop Competition pushes for thinking along the lines of safety and security by ensuring that its teams are building controls systems that have fail safes and scalable operational systems at both the design stage of the competition and when the top 20 teams in the design category actually attend the competition at the SpaceX headquarters. In doing so, it even provides recommendations of hardware needed to build these systems, as the issue of safety is already paramount at the competition level; an uncontrolled pod in a 1 mile vacuum chamber could implode. Last year, the recommended piece of technology was a Ubiquiti Networks branded wireless link. But, this does not go far enough, as the actual controls devices used can be either really cheap microcontroller devices rigged togethers, such, as Arduinos, or really expensive programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and the code needed to be written for both is largely different. 

Thus, a gap emerges: teams with strong business development skillsets and great connections build sophisticated systems with PLCs, while teams with weaker business development skills and fewer connections in the industry develop cheaper controls systems.

Great, but doesn’t that self select who should be building hyperloops and who shouldn’t be? After all, hyperloop development is expensive and will only take place with a public-private partnership.
More than the money, the time spent on controls setup and coding forces most hyperloop organizations that are starting out to focus on the bare minimum pod setup needed before working on solving new problems in the industry. While this would be fine in any other, well established transportation industry, this prevents strong growth in hyperloop, which depends on new engineers, business developers,and designers to bring new perspectives to solve new problems towards the development of a full scale hyperloop system. 

As such, there has been little innovative growth in the hyperloop world: problems around the power requirements of the scaling of vacuum systems, the airlock systems that would be needed in order to facilitate stations for unloading and loading, the method of multi-track routing, and the structural implements needed to support a steel tube have yet to truly be solved, or even thoroughly addressed. While larger hyperloop companies, such as Virgin Hyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, are undoubtedly finding solutions to these problems, the task of building controls systems from scratch prevents many other, talented researchers with much less time and fewer personnel from being able to properly participate in the development of this new field. 

Wonderful. But, what are you going to do about this?
The Hard Tech Fund is facilitating collaboration between Cooper Hyperloop, HyperXite, Hyperloop IITB, and Strathloop to develop a shared controls software architecture for hyperloop pods that can be scaled effectively across microcontroller and PLC setups. To do this, we aim to focus on connectivity to the core components of the hyperloop pod, which includes the linear induction motors (LIMs) used to move the pod forward, the eddy current and kinetic brakes used to stop the pod, the stability and suspension system used to keep the pod level, along with a strong network access panel implementation and secondary system setup across all contact points to ensure that communication to the pod is done easily and quickly, and a lack of communication can lead to a safe shutdown. 

We aim to complete this project by January 2021 to allow for ample preparation time and further system adjustment of the controls systems for upcoming hyperloop pod competitions, which look to include the SpaceX Hyperloop Competition, AZLoop’s Hyperloop Competition, and a European Hyperloop Competition. After this point, further maintenance will be completed yearly as part of the Hard Tech Fund Hyperloop Symposium to ensure that the software remains current and that no one team has the burden of completing all the controls work themselves.

How much are you looking to raise? How will funds be used and distributed? 
We are looking to raise a minimum of 5,000 DAI. The funds will be distributed equally amongst the teams and the Hard Tech Fund, with each team and the Hard Tech Fund receiving 25% of the money. Distribution will occur via Aragon DAO according to these rules. The funds received by the teams will be used to pay for a programmable logic controller, a set of microcontrollers, electronics equipment to allow for the transfer of signals from propulsion, braking devices to the logic controllers, and to partially subsidize salaries of team members who work half or full time on the controls development. All funding received by the Hard Tech Fund will go into subsidizing salaries of the team working on managing controls scaling. All transactions completed by the Hard Tech Fund with their share of the money thereafter will be publicly posted ETH transactions to ensure that there is full transparency in the use of funds by the organization. If more than 100,000 DAI is raised, Hard Tech Fund will set up community based voting to complete further breakup of its portion of the funds to more hyperloop teams.

What is the future of this project after its completion? 
We hope that this controls work will go be the beginnings of a standardized hyperloop controls system that is adopted by the NETT Council, the Government of Maharashtra, the Government of of Toulouse, and other municipalities looking to engage in hyperloop specific work, and we look for them and their corporate partners to be attendees at the next Hyperloop Symposium to help line up that development. 

More importantly, we hope this work cuts development time for newer hyperloop teams with regards to pod development, and pushes them to focus on harder, more pressing issues of hyperloop scalability, especially relating to the vacuums. 

Lastly, if hyperloop at scale does turn out to be too infeasible even after further development work, we hope that the structure of collaborative editing that we have run through our Hyperloop Symposium and this fair division of funds and human resources of development will endure into further infrastructure projects. 

Who are the participating organizations? 
Cooper Hyperloop, HyperXite, Strathloop, and Hyperloop IITB are three university-based hyperloop organizations that are working together on this initiative. They have all published papers on the work that their teams have completed or aim to complete, with HyperXite and Hyperloop IITB focused on pod design and Strathloop focusing on energy and airlock scalability, which were all submitted to the Hard Tech Fund Hyperloop Symposium on Aug 22-23 and 29-30. You can view the reviews for papers on Weekend 1 here (https://www.hardtechfund.com/symposium1.html) and weekend 2 here (https://www.hardtechfund.com/symposium2.html). Papers will be available on the site shortly.

Cooper Hyperloop: The Cooper Hyperloop team was founded in 2018 as an extracurricular club for students of The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City. It is an undergraduate student-led team currently composed of 16 hard working Mechanical, Electrical and Chemical engineers. Cooper Hyperloop’s goal is to design a scalable and rugged and safe prototype of a Hyperloop pod in order to spur research and development in this revolutionary method of transportation. Since 2018 the team has expanded and been integrated into Cooper Unions’s curriculum, allowing members to receive course credit for their efforts. 
In 2019 The team competed in SpaceX’s Hyperloop competition IV and placed in the top 40 teams globally. In 2020 the Cooper Hyperloop participated in the Hard Tech Fund’s Symposium. 
 

HyperXite: HyperXite has been established since SpaceX Hyperloop Competition was first introduced in 2015. HyperXite is a student-led team that participates in the Hyperloop competition. Through researching and developing prototypes, we aim to revolutionize the transportation industry at a low cost, while ensuring the safety, health and welfare of the public. 

HyperXite has competed in the past four Spacex Hyperloop Pod Competitions.
In Competition I, HyperXite was one of the semifinalists and placed fifth for their overall design worldwide. Additionally, the HyperXite pod was one of the only air levitated pods to be tested within the Hyperloop itself during Competition II and placed in the top 6. In the past two competitions, HyperXite was one of the top 22 finalists to attend competition in Hawthorne, CA.
Our team, currently consisting of 20 members, is working to research, design, build, and validate a small-scale pod to be tested on the team’s own test track.
Because of the delayed competition this year, our funding has considerably decreased. With the help of this grant, we are hoping to reach our goal of manufacturing a mini prototype pod that we would be able to test and develop throughout the school year.


Strathloop: Strathloop was founded in October 2018 within the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, UK. 

Currently, the team of 90 students is researching and developing a series of Hyperloop systems feasibility projects, along with other projects focusing on assessing and developing the infrastructure required to make Hyperloop possible. 
Over the coming University session, Strathloop plans to design and manufacture a fully functional Hyperloop pod prototype for entry into the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition. Control Systems design will be right at the heart of the pod prototype project. With current COVID-19 restrictions, control systems have been the only sub-team able to continue its physical testing plan throughout the summer months. 

Therefore, grant funding would be a useful asset to this development in collaboration with the other teams in our consortium to develop a system architecture that is useful not only for the pod prototype, but for the Hyperloop concept as a whole.

Hyperloop IITB: Hyperloop IITB was established in Sept. 2019 at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India with the vision to participate in the SpaceX hyperloop pod competition and promote research and interest in the Hyperloop technology within the student community.

The team, currently, consists of 50 students working in different subsystems- Aerodynamics, Dynamics and Levitation, Controls and Power, Propulsion, Structure, Marketing and Design- to build a small scale prototype of the Hyperloop pod. Our team, though being relatively new, has proved it’s mettle in competitions like Arizona desert loop competition and the Inter IIT Design conclave. 

Due to the uncertainty of the final dates of the competition due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our team is low on funds. The factor of being a new team just adds to the challenge.With this grant, we hope to work at a greater pace to develop the small scale model for test run as soon as possible.

Hard Tech Fund: Hard Tech Fund was started in 2019 at UC Davis as a way to turn projects coming out of Oneloop, Davis' Hyperloop Team, into products and services in order to help spur full hyperloop development in the Sacramento Valley. In fact, it was even part of the team's whitepaper for future development, which was shared with the Sacramento Area Council of Governments and the UC Davis Chancellor, Gary May.

In order to prove that the team could be given money to help fund these new startups, Hard Tech Fund started a summer program from June to August of 2019 to help any team working on sustainability related ideas due to the demand for a hands-on, product focused incubator at UC Davis. This program ended with a demo day at the Blockchain Center in San Francisco and was attended by seed and pre-seed investment groups. Of the 3 teams who participated in Hard Tech Fund, 1 team went on to be provided further resources for further development.

Seeing a greater need for sustainability product development programs at UC Davis, Hard Tech Fund created a student specific organization called Hard Tech Campus, which is a UC Davis student club, and refocused on hyperloop development to investigate how to best help existing teams and to work towards the ideals set up by the Oneloop whitepaper, which led to the creation of this symposium.

The team behind Hard Tech Fund is multidisciplinary. Blake Anneberg, Director of Outreach, is the founder of InTheHyperloop, the best and only hyperlooop-specific YouTube channel, and the Colorado Hyperloop Coalition. Linda Huang, Director of Design, is a founding employee and Lead Designer at Ethicli, a browser extension to help consumers by online ethically. Kirk McGregor, Director of New Initiatives, is an independent grant writer working on high technology projects, such as high performance computing (HPC), x-ray technology, and quantum computation. Samarth Sandeep, President, is currently the founder of Iff, a biomaterial design company, and previously served as the Business Team Director at Oneloop.

Custom decorations are put up for each event and taken down shortly after. Musical performances happen regularly in select instances. 

My focus with The Great Pug is the social space it provides. I want it to be a place you visit for the other people you find there.

Why should you fund this project?
Contributing will help me continue my work on The Pug. I'll put the money towards anything that can support the continued development of The Great Pug. Be it assets, hardware, training or caffeine.

1456,the-augmented-reality-game-cryptolandy,"""Cryptolandy"" is more than a game, it is the ""Secret Land"", the entrance to which became available by augmented reality, where augmented reality intertwines with real life.
In the structure of the Cryptolandy ecosystem of economics and management, the prizes received for achievements in the game, become material.
The prize for micropayments and time spent in the game is the ERC20 CRYPL token.
From the very beginning, CRYPL tokens, which are the main prize for the winners, can be sold or bought on the exchange.
Token CRYPL gives its owner the opportunity to receive dividends from the fees of the game. 49% of the micropayments collected by the game are used to pay dividends on active CRYPL tokens issued.
The number of CRYPL tokens is limited to 100,000,000, over time, their value will only increase.
Only the first million tokens will be sold on the exchange, the remaining 99 million will be prizes for the game activity of the participants.
51% of the funds collected by the micro payments game are paid as prize money in the form of CRYPL ERC20 tokens, which allow their owners not only to receive 49% of the funds collected by the game in the form of dividends, but also manage the game’s reserve fund by sending it to various projects.
Projects are submitted for discussion and subsequent voting. The justice of the vote is monitored by 12 knights of the game. Each of them is given its own signature and its own, Cryptolandy blockchain node that will perform the functions of controlling the game. Knights are selected from the owners of the largest number of CRYPL tokens.
With an increase in the collection of micropayments in the game, the amount of dividend payments on CRYPL tokens will also increase. The attractiveness of tokens for investors will also increase the value of preferred shares of the game on the exchange, which are CRYPL tokens.
At least 10% of the game’s reserve fund will be directed to such necessary things as saving forests and animals, garbage collection, and affairs necessary for the survival of mankind.
Thanks to augmented reality and prizes in the form of CRYPL tokens, players will be able to plant virtual trees in parks where possible, and then plant real ones. Clean up landfills and improve wildlife habitats.
These 10% will be paid from the prize pool, so that they will not harm the owners of tokens.
The game of augmented reality is needed to attract people's attention to what is happening with our planet.

The device of the modern world is unfair, control keys belong to a small number of people. With the advent of blockchain, humanity has the opportunity to distribute the levers of economic management among more people, consensus is the main achievement of the blockchain.
Smart voting and expense management contracts will allow the system to organize itself.
Cryptolandy will become a harbinger of a new fair world, as tokens, in other words, keys to control the world, are distributed among people in accordance with their contribution to the ecosystem.

We are introducing the proposal to create SUMA assets - assets powered by UMA Protocol that track the real value of lending & borrowing rates for all DeFi platforms

For this grant, we are proposing to launch the following features and add-ons to what was built during ETHBoston:

Work towards an oracle/framework to track interest rates on centralized platforms (connecting APIs from providers/historical feeds)
Analyze historical ""inversions"" or spreads between centralized and decentralized lending/borrowers
Create a classification/tagging of all the centralized/decentralized lending platforms and their parameters to better quantify a ""real rate"" that includes all the various factors
For example, an interest rate in which the collateral may also earn interest allows for additional ""real interest rate"", such as backing a CDP with cETH rather than ETH.
Look into uniswap docs to see if we can get SUMA-style v1 assets issued and traded on a test Uniswap.

Funds will be used to pay for AWS storage of some previous interest rate data and fund the development of the above goals.

Fees are paid in Ether and stored in a smart contract, to be pooled with JUKE tokens upon the release of Jukebox v2.

In Jukebox v2, JUKE (ERC-20) tokens will be used to pay for fees. Upon payment, the entirety of JUKE tokens spent will be burned, creating an ever-depleting supply. Additionally, time slots will be represented as NFTs and will be able to be bought and sold on the open market.

1989,subsidiumdao-philanthropic-protocol-for-defi,"Philanthropy Focused DAO
Subsidium was created as a collective to provide a bridge between Layer 0 problems with Layer 1 solutions, all while in a package that benefits everyone. In light of all the recent amazing innovations that have happened on Ethereum we find that there is no better time than now to help onboard those who are really in need to sharing the benefits of Decentralized Finance. Subsidium aims to continually provide additional utility to existing Smart Contract based yielding protocols with a focus on making philanthropy easy.

----> Basic Introductory Questions:
	How is SubsidiumDAO different from other donation, charity based platforms?
This project is different in that it adds universal utility across all of the Ethereum mainnet, and eventually L2 solutions. Furthermore Subsidium provides the added benefit of utilizing ""Tax, Accounting & Proofs"" for free so that all users who contribute to the donation pool will have the relevant tax return information for their jurisdiction and a chance to govern where these funds are donated.
Why do we need a Decentralized Autonomous Organization to manage the philanthropy vaults & funds?
As the founder of Subsidium Digital, I personally  believe it is imperative that when funds are allocated for philanthropic purposes that full accountability , traceability and governance should be at hand. Things are actively changing in the social climate of our world, resources need allocating to different problems in rapid transition (as seen with the novel-covid-19 pandemic). Private bodies govern charitable funds currently, and even in current renditions of platforms offered on the Ethereum network the charities and recipients of the funds are chosen by centralized bodies without full traceability of funds. SubsidiumDAO solves this.
Where can i find more information regarding the ""Initial Coin Offering"" and DAO Structure?
Currently there is no plans to publicly release the governance token until Q3 of 2021. The reason for this is based upon research over  DeFi ICO's that occurred between Q1-Q4 of 2020. We want to do this in the fairest, most community focused manor. 
You'll find the DAO structure on our Website.

Building the Philanthropic Yield Protocol (PYP):
This has also been referred to as Project ONE which will be the initial protocol owned and governed by the DAO and its influencing donators (Achieved through Social/Governed consensus mechanism)
Based on the ""Yield Split"" mechanism - (DeFi platforms utilizing this protocol will allow their users to interact and sign a percentage of nominated yield to be sent to the philanthropic DAO.)
Users who nominate a percentage of their yield will be sent a (PYP) utility token that continually tracks their contribution to the SubsidiumDAO between snapshots.
(PYP) has additional utility in that 
a) its used to track your tax write off position that is continually yielding between donation periods. 
b) Is used for Off-Chain ""Snapshot"" based governance to influence SubsidiumDAO's decisions in its distribution of fund donations.
c) Balance of (PYP) Is cleared on receipt of ""Proof of Donation"" that will allow individual DeFi yielders to claim tax write offs on charitable donations. 
""Proof of Donation"" includes: Proof of charity using ethnamingservice, transaction data, and relevant blockchain trail leading to the ""yield split"" mechanism and the users original signature. 

More Information is continually published through our website and social media platforms. Devs n Contributors feel free to get in touch we'd love to hear feedback regarding the project.

626,dapplaunch-web-3-marketing-messaging-platform,"What is DappLaunch?
DappLaunch is a platform for decentralized application developers to build, manage, and communicate with audiences, using Web 3 email.

What problem are you solving?
DApp and web 3 developers often launch 'Coming Soon' landing pages or send out news and updates using email addresses. Despite, in most cases, ruining a user's ability to remain anonymous, it is difficult to track back to user conversion (i.e. Did Bob sign up? Did Alice take this offer?)

Using existing Ethereum primitives, DappLaunch enables developers to collect and communicate with Ethereum account addresses.

Getting Started
To get started, you simply sign up at https://dapplaunch.xyz.
Next, create a 'Site', then copy the generated form code to your website or landing page and start collecting web 3 addresses. Then, create and schedule HTML-based campaigns to send out to your subscribers.

What's the user experience like today?
DappLaunch provides a familiar experience to email marketing software with automatically generated form code, ability to manage multiple sites and campaigns, editable contacts list, drag-and-drop editing of HTML messaging, campaign scheduling, bulk mailing, etc.

When did the project start?
This was an EthLondon project by the Mailchain team in March 2020. You can read about it in the blog post here.

What protocols does it support?
Ethereum (+ testnets)

Does it support ENS?
Of course!

What is the grant for?
Speeding up development, improving UX, and adding more features.

How does this help the Ethereum ecosystem?
As more DApp teams build their decentralized projects and games, it is important to their marketing experts with the types of tooling and user experiences they are already familiar with. DappLaunch is intuitive for any marketer who has worked with email marketing platforms.

594,nufi-an-open-ethereum-only-dao-based-alternative-,"TL;DR:
We're starting a site to replace the need for DeFi to use sites like Dapp.com and CoinMarketCap.com; and allow Ethereum content creators to posts guides, tutorial and news about DeFi products in a centralized location.

It will be community owned.
It will be run by a DAO.
Content creators earn their share of revenue.

Background:
I am tired.

I am tired of trying to introduce people to DeFi where I:

Send people to sites like Dapp.com to explore DeFi.
Hear they've bought EOS, Tron or some other non-decentralized blockchain.
Play with scammy apps.
Decide that all of crypto is a scam and leave the space.

Our current DApp trackers are not a public good. They are a public menace. 

This is why I am creating ""NuFi"" - an open Ethereum focused DApp/price tracker which will monitor, review and promote legitimate projects in the Ethereum ecosystem that add value to the space.

What's Wrong With Current Trackers? 

The top DApp trackers in the space are ""DAppRader"", ""Dapp Review"", ""StateOfTheDApps"" and ""DApp.com"", ""

All of them have either:

Taken paid promotion to show ads for scams and ponzi schemes.
Promoted gambling apps on centralized chains as ""Promoted Apps"" or ""Editors Choice"" to promote their referral link.
Sent emails to users promoting the benefits of Tron over Ethereum (likely paid.)
Used vague metrics to push users towards Tron and EOS based apps.

The worst of these is DApp.com - here is a summary of just some of the shady things they've done:

For months took money from a ponzi scam called ""Mining Expert"" to create custom ads on their site both in the top rail (https://i.imgur.com/J0R8LfD.png) and as the featured app (https://i.imgur.com/spWc1ou.png). Once the apps marketing deal ran out, then and only then did they label the app as a scam (https://twitter.com/dapp_com/status/1242087101962702848).

After raising $1M in Angel Funding proceeded to launch a vague Dapp.com token for a DApp store, and multichain identity wallet. Raising another few million in this sale, with a whitepaper that bashed the shortcomings of Ethereum, so far their ""DApp store"" simply redirects users to the website of other apps and seems to be pay-to-list.

Announced a 'Partnership' with the ICON Blockchain where when you click the ""Ranking"" button on DApp.com it takes you only to https://www.dapp.com/ranking/ICON and hides other blockchains to start.

These sites do not care about supporting, highlighting or promoting actual quality DApps and DeFi tools - they are simply money grabs.

Why Do We Need A Site?

Decentralized systems win when:

It's easy to find good quality projects.
It's easy to learn how to use these projects.
All of this can be done without risk of finding bad projects.

Most DeFi projects, and in turn the tokens and DAOs that support them, are designed for consumer scale. By making it easy to on board new users in a trusted environment the entire industry wins.

What Will The Site Do?

Just like current DApp we'll list DeFi products based on a number of key metrics. We'll also have a section to track the price of Ethereum and DeFi assets.

Unlike other existing sites, all projects/assets listed will have to meet strict community review criteria to be accepted.

Each project will also include tutorials and reviews about the product from community members. Any member of the community can submit content and if it meets the quality guidelines (i.e. is not spam) the article will be published.

The NuFi site will still run (ethical non-invasive) ads, but, advertisements must be for reviewed products that meet the community guidelines. The site will split revenue with any tutorial/review writers based on their share of impressions, allowing content creators in the space to leverage the power of collective negotiation in advertising sales. The NuFi site itself will cover costs, and 100% of all left over earnings after costs of goods sold will be used to support other projects in the space.

For The Community; By The Community:
Beyond just making payments out to community members, NuFi will aim to move all the management of the site under a DAO managed by its community.

The initial DAO tokens will be granted to:

Community members based on their contributions in creating and translating content.
Community members based on their contributions referring new users to the site.
Community members who initially helped build the site.
Members of key communities in the space who have helped support public goods (Ethereum Foundation, MetaCartel, Moloch DAO, Magicians, Cat Herders)
Gitcoin grant backers (those who back any grant not just this one)
*Any group or individual who doesn't wish to claim their allocation will have that allocation burned so that the voting power will simply be distributed among other holders of the token.

The initial allocations will be decided down the line, but, the DAO will have control over the direction of the website and future fund allocation so that it can best represent the specific needs of the community.

We'll explore the possibility of needing to align a financial incentive with the tokens, but, aim to keep it at a minimum required to secure the DAO. Our expectation is that the groups who are taking part in the DAO are all individuals who have shown an interesting in supporting public goods for sake of raising the space, and therefore do not need a secondary incentive to act in good faith for the Ethereum ecosystem.

The Power of Collective Bargaining:

Right now, the Ethereum community has hundreds of fantastic content creators stretched across multiple platforms, each trying to make it on their own. 

Being an independent content creator, supported by ads or users, in 2020 is a tough slog.

Consider that an independent blogger in the finance sector can expect to earn somewhere between $0.50 - $5 per thousand views, meanwhile sites like Yahoo Finance, Investing.com, Seeking Alpha and MarketWatch earn between $10 - $60 per thousand views.

Why?

By having such a large volume of content, users, and views, they are able to support dedicated sales teams who can sell ad space directly to brands instead of through automated markets.

It also means when negotiating affiliate agreements with products and services, you have the leverage to pursue higher rates.

This means we win in two ways:

Collective bargaining results in higher CPMs and therefore higher earnings for content creators.
Content creators can focus on their content creation rather than chasing sponsorships and ad-deals. Meaning the community gets more high quality content.

Fund Goals:
Our goal is to reach a minimum allocation of $5k to build out the minimally viable platform. In the event we fail to reach that goal, we'll reallocate any funds raised to other open-source and public goods projects, or funding issues on Gitcoin.

I doubt we would reach much higher levels, but, here is what we could do if our funding went further:

At $7k: We'd be able to build out a more robust user front-end, to make it easier for non-technical content creators to create robust content with WYSIWYG tools.

At $10k: We'll improve the user-facing design. Working with a designer we'll develop a clean and professional looking UX to make it easy for new users to navigate the space.

 At $15k: We'll establish grants to seed great initial tutorial content to the site from community influencers (@Sassal, @chrisblec, @RyanSAdams - I'm looking at you guys!)

At $20k: We'll find a way to do automated on-chain payments rather than manual. We'd also include professional translations in the top 6 most spoken languages of all our initial content.

Allocation of Funds:
100% of the funds raised here will be allocated to freelancers building the product.

I'm not personally taking any money off the top of this grant, 100% of it will be paid out for people's time.

Who We Will Hire:
In looking for freelancers we will specifically hire individuals from the Ethereum community to better support our own ecosystem. We'll try and focus this first on any developers, designers and content creators who may have been displaced by the Covid19 pandemic.

My Personal Investment:
Beyond my involvement and the domain name, I'll also commit to covering the first year of hosting for the project (or until it becomes self-sustaining). I'll also commit the first $2500 towards this grant which is 50% of our minimum goal.

How to Use the Funds
Development of a more user-friendly GUI for users
It's tedious for many users to understand the protocol methods and their meanings, and we think we need an easy-to-use console GUI.
For users who want to help with open assets but get tired of choosing which assets to stake, we're also going to provide an automated staking pool with the right algorithms.
Building tools for third-party developers
The protocol is open, so we're not going to expand the ecosystem on only our own, we're going to roll it out with a lot of third parties.
Building documentation for third-party developers.
Building a Development Kit.
Development of a GraphQL interface for easy querying of data stored in the contracts. (prototype already completed)
Protocol enhancements
Dev Protocol hopes to grow in a community-driven way with an open add-on/update mechanism. Show role models and revise core code to make it easier for add-ons and updates by the community.
Development of an add-on tokenization method to serve as a role model.
Building a development kit and an oraclization protocol to make it easy for users to develop the Market.
Lower gas fees.
Transitioning to decentralized ownership.

2- Nature of Relationships changes
3- Nature of Money changes

UNITE THE WORLD

NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT 

Created by common people, not from politicians. 
We are creating a community to start writing the bases of the universal constitution on the open web, allowing every people from all over the world to be part.

We have the dream to write a Global Universal Constitution by Smart Contract.

People, don’t trust in anything. Don’t trust in Govs, Don’t trust in politicians, Don’t trust in multinationals companies. 
We believe in digital, We believe exponential technologies will give us the tools to heal the planet after this Crisis.



Little Storytelling: 

Once upon a time, there was a terrible pandemic that paused life around the world as people from different cultures felt suddenly taken away from the life they know, that was comfortable.
Every day…. people found connection through news from those in the family, friends, and in the headlines they read about how we were all affected similarly and what actions we had to take to be safe.
Then One day… the strength of that connection with others grew so strong that it overpowered the nay-sayers, government officials, and authorities trying to return to a time where white men and the ruling class had unquestioned power.


What is happening NOW in the world order? (Present)

For fans of the multilateral world order, this week has been the most important week about it. 
It started on June 11 with the G7 Summit in England, where among other things the leaders of seven of the world's leading democracies agreed on a global minimum corporate tax rate and committed to vaccinate the world. 

Three days later, the leaders of the NATO (Nort Atlantic Treaty organization) countries met in Bruselas, where they laid plans to build an infrastructure project to rival China's Belt and Road Initiative

On June 15 US president Joe Biden held a summit with EU leaders 

After that, European leaders got a breather, but Biden went on to Switzerland, to meet on June 16 Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. 

WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN? other than that the White House advance team probably needs a vacation? It’s hard to say.

But there is too much riding on these meetings. (climate change, war, the resilience of the global economy to future pandemics, and the recovery from this one) for it all to be hot air. Summits are a good thing, but only if they trigger action, not more summits. As Henry Kissinger warned, “When statesmen want to gain time, they offer to talk.” 

It’s our turn: WE THE PEOPLE. We have to ACT. (Creating New E-GLobal Government)
It's the turn of others countries as well, not only the countries of G7.

We are starting to unify the entire world with Special Economic zones first, like European Economic Community but starting from small countries, of course, the most ambitious goal is to unify the entire planet earth at the end. 

This is the project we are starting with:

http://sez.network 
At the same time, we created International Passports on the Ethereum ecosystem. 

Global Planet E-Residence.

Digitalizing Governments, digitalizing citizens around the world.

The purpose is to give freedom to people. Everyone belonging to the same reliable digital jurisdiction, THE EARTH.


We are creating our Web3 media & community projects. 
With Blockchain voting and Open Web, we are ready to build an open digital Global Government !!!

Sourcify enables transparent and human-readable smart contract interactions through automated Solidity contract verification, contract metadata, and NatSpec comments. 

At its core, Sourcify currently maintains
an interface that helps developers to verify metadata and contract source code.
a contract repository of all verified contracts.
a contract lookup interface for the contract repository.
a monitoring & verifier service that checks for new contracts on Ethereum blockchains (mainnet and testnets) and tries to verify them automatically.
a metadata playground, an educational interface to learn about Solidity metadata

Sourcify provides a base layer, which allows other tools to be built on top of it. One of its main purposes is to keep metadata and source files available via IPFS and Swarm (preventing that the links in the bytecode turn into dead links).

Besides the technical infrastructure, Sourcify is also a collective movement to bring transparency and awareness to the space. We try to educate and build bridges between development tools, wallets, interfaces and other components which all play an important role in demystifying interaction with smart contracts for the end user and hence making blockchain interactions safer.

How are we going to use the funds? 

Funds collected will be mainly used to pay transaction fees! We'll update the contract repository more frequently and keep our ENS domain sourcify.eth up-to-date.

443,cretter-solving-critical-thinking-and-debates-on-,"When people debate online, they usually risk their reputation. Random users with no reputation are shoved in the category of trolls or idiots, without the chance of expressing their argument or logic. Hence, social media is showered with famous personalities (aka influencers) playing the status game. Status signaling and only saying things their audience expect them to. We’ve fallen in a world where popularity is a proxy for truth or authority.

The truth is true, no matter who’s saying it. No website solved critical thinking or the search for the truth because the first thing humans care about when they hear something is “who it is coming from and what’s their status”.

If high status, we listen. If low status, we ignore.

On Cretter, we believe we’ve solved the problem by eliminating names or personalities. The only proxy used is money and reasoning. A website where you can back up anything you tell the world is true.

When you can back it up, you make money. When not, it is taken away from you.

We think we got right or close to right, the proper incentivization of all stakeholders on Cretter. A permissionless critical thinking platform built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Cretter is the platform where:

The amount you stake (risk) is how much you believe in something.
You can monetize your belief. (The closer to the truth, the easier to monetize)


You'll see the mechanics on why if a user has a strong truth, the money inside the statement (smart contract) grows and expands, while if someone is pushing a lie they will shrink and get drained to the critical questioners and rankers.

Our ""impact"" is our long-term goal North Star: ""Physical automation literacy for all Peoples."" Our deck: http://deck.cheerbot.org and elevator pitch http://3minutepitch.cheerbot.org .

There aren't many open source ""public good"" GitHub repos for Web3 tech on Raspberry Pi, even though there's lots of potential there.

This grant supports building out our repo exploring that Web3-Rpi potential with fun and lucrative verticals, e.g.: https://github.com/cheerbotme/pixelart

More about Cheerbot at https://cheerbot.org (including who's on our artist team and multisig). 

As of now, Cheerbot is a collectible toy that people can just plug in and enjoy the pixel art animations. 

For instance, Kevin enjoys his primo Cheerbot.



But it's built with Raspberry Pi, so it's secretly a fun way to get open source alternatives to ""Amazon Echo"" and other similar smart home devices into the Web3 community's hands. (Shhh, don't tell Web2 😉.)



Cheerbot is a member of the Gitcoin family, and the primo toys shown above is our interpretation of the EthBot that fights Moloch of lore. 



By the end of 2022, we expect Cheerbot will be able to develop free open source software ""public good"" via the profits we make from selling phygital goods. Until then, your help is very much appreciated!! https://github.com/cheerbotme

Unless we take on a very ambitious open source project, we hope to permanently grow beyond this community's generosity and, hopefully, be in a position to pay it forward! 

But until then, y'all remain the reason we've had the runway to build our primo and economy price point MVPs. Thank you 🙏 !!

Your GR12 support gave us the opportunity to build the primo Cheerbot and showcase it at EthDenver's Solar Punk exhibit for Schelling Point. 


Your GR13 support gave us the opportunity to build the eco Cheerbot (shown above) that we're finishing up now, and plan to sell at an accessible price point very soon! 

We have a few surprise phygital innovations we're excited to share with you... 

We're looking forward to soon maturing Cheerbot enough that it becomes a DAO community partnered with Maker Spaces to communally build permissionless blockchain applications in completely new and IRL situations.




(above: estimated cost savings if developers decide to use a Cheerbot for their microinstance needs)

Most of our content & knowledge base is also free, open-source, & available as digital public goods across our various websites, blogs, & social accounts.

After losing 1 of our parkour facilities during early covid, we bounced back to win the inaugural WCT USA held in October 2020. A few of us are huge supporters of Ethereum and so this summer, we added ETH to our WCT team name in order to help raise awareness of this game-changing culture & technology. Last month, we won our 2nd straight USA championship which aired on ESPN.

If you haven't seen WCT, check out a match on YouTube:
→ 2020 finals: https://youtu.be/JtB4IDhOZIQ
→ 2021 finals: https://youtu.be/n29ni9Khe14

Now we're training for the WCT world championships tentatively scheduled for summer 2022. Over the next few months of preparation & competition, we'll see significant training costs related to renting or buying a WCT course to train on, travel expenses, athlete/coach pay, & more. We operated at a heavy loss for the previous 2 events and are looking for funding & partners to help make this more sustainable long-term.

If we can raise $10k of funding, we'll be able to cover most, if not all of our basic expenses for competing at WCT worlds. If we reach $25k, we can also buy/build our own WCT course to train on. If we reach $50k, we'll be able to properly invest in our top athletes & coaches for the first time ever.

We're well-researched advocates of Ethereum in general, and supporters of many projects within the ecosystem including Gitcoin, Bounties, Uniswap, InstaDapp, Compound, Aave, OpenSea, MetaMask, ShapeShift, Brave, Pool Together, Immutable/GU, Bankless, & more. We'd love to work more closely with quality projects & developers like these in order to show the world of sports, parkour, & fitness what's possible on ETH.

Trust-minimized
Collusion-resistant
Sybil-resistant
Non-exclusive
Pseudonymous
“Serverless” (Client-side app that can run locally and is hosted on GitHub pages or IPFS)
A viable candidate for protocol level funding

Learn more at blog.clr.fund.

How will the gitcoin grants funding be used?
Funds received in this round will be used to:
fund the continued development of clr.fund
provide matching funds to future clr.fund rounds

F.A.Q.
Where is the evidence that it will work?
Gitcoin Grants is probably the best evidence of the Ethereum community’s appetite for quadratic funding of public goods. What they’ve done for the space over the last year has been nothing short of amazing; proving the power of quadratic funding by allocating over half a million dollars in direct contributions and matched funds to Ethereum public goods.

Why can’t we just use Gitcoin Grants?
Protocol level funding requires a fund allocation protocol.

We absolutely love Gitcoin Grants and what it has done for the Ethereum community. But Gitcoin is a for-profit company based in the US; they are a single point of failure and beholden to US regulation in a way that a fund allocation protocol is not.

We aim to build something that would be a viable recipient of protocol level funding, because we believe a fund allocation protocol will enable a whole different class of people and entities to participate in quadratic funding, as recipients, contributors, and matchers. This could the the protocol itself (via something like Block Reward Funding), L2 fees and MEV, altruistic dapps, DAOs, and community members, or contributors who wish to maintain anonymity.

2451,audit-of-noble-secp256k1-cryptographic-library,"Update: we have passed the audit. Check out the PDF from cure53. Kudos to every contributor!

noble-secp256k1 is the fastest javascript implementation of elliptic curve cryptography over curve secp256k1. The library is open-source & free to use for commercial and non-commercial projects under MIT license.

Why is it important
If you’re using ETH, you’re using secp256k1. Simple as that. All transactions are signed by secp keys. If you’re using metamask, you’re using a third-party library that implements secp256k1. Transactions, trades, nft mints, etc - require a working reputable elliptic curve crypto lib. If the library is bad, you can lose funds by an accident, or have them stolen.

Why noble instead of an other library
Javascript has huge exposure to supply chain attacks. Metamask uses more than 500 modules directly, or indirectly. Hacking just one dependency exposes all metamask users to potential loss of funds. That’s a huge risk that cannot always be mitigated by sandboxing like Lavamoat.

The main idea behind noble-crypto was to create library that doesn’t use other libraries. So-called zero/minimal-dependency approach works pretty well — if someone is feeling like reading the whole dependency tree, it can be done pretty easily.

Noble also serves as a great learning resource for cryptography beginners. The code is well-written and can be understood by non-cryptographers.

I have been working on it for free for the last couple years. The progress was tremendous: recently, it received support for Schnorr signature scheme. Noble is now the fastest pure-js library for secp256k1 (see the benchmarks on GitHub). It is also the smallest one: only 800 lines of easily readable cross-platform JS code. For comparison, a popular alternative called elliptic is 10 times larger: https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=elliptic@6.5.4

Check out a blog post about it: https://paulmillr.com/posts/noble-secp256k1-fast-ecc/

The audit
We’re engaging cure53, a well-known company of security experts that helped to audit ETH foundation’s Mist in 2016-2017 (https://mobile.twitter.com/avsa/status/1304483988497629184). They will check the library for all sorts of vulnerabilities & correctness of cryptographic primitives. We need $6250 for the audit.

Further development
Any additional money will be spent on continued development of secp256k1 & bls12-381.

Why a Gitcoin Grant?

The intent of this funding is to allow the Dxdao to get started on this project ahead of its planned fundraising effort. Once the Dxdao raises its own funds, it will be able to fund development and maintenance of Mix.eth. The jumpstart this fundraiser will enable will help to demonstrate the value of the Dxdao and support said fundraising efforts.

Possible adoption of EIP-1057 require ethminer to evolve and support ProgPoW hashing algorithm embracing the same principles which have lead development of ethereum till now : openness, security, performance.

Proposal
Ethminer is, at present, the most advanced, best supported, and actively maintained ethash miner in the open-source scope. Adoption of EIP-1057 by Ethereum’s blockchain, if not properly supported by ethminer, would create a wound in miner’s audience which could only rely on shady and closed-sourced mining software to take advantage of their GPU and ProgPoW. This would create a secondary, equally undesirable, dominance position by closed-source developers: the ASIC resistance EIP-1057 means to reinforce would end up in an impairment of the clearness which stands at the basis of the whole Ethereum project.

To accomplish this goal the ethminer’s dev team means to review the application stack introducing ProgPoW as additional algorithm to be activated under any of these circumstances.

Cold algo selection
First step in ProgPoW implementation is to embed the algo within the runnable GPU kernels. Due to this the mining software could be activated to grind either classic Ethash or ProgPoW. This should be considered the first staging phase only to test and tune GPUs at best

Warm algo switching
Final step is to design ethminer in a way capable to switch algo on the fly. This implies a signal must be carried at mining protocol level (namely stratum) so the miner can choose which algo to enforce in the mining of next block of data. This phase involves actors which are beyond ethminer’s scope: pools, for instance, should embrace such modifications in protocol. At present, however, there is no standard stratum protocol for ethereum mining: there are mainly three different flavours carried out without coordination by any pool.
Our proposal is to adopt and extend actual EthereumStratum/1.0.0. Implementation (https://github.com/nicehash/Specifications/blob/master/EthereumStratum_NiceHash_v1.0.0.txt) which can offer a robust documentation skeleton and already solves many of the verbosity issues which affect other stratum flavours.
This extension (which will be called EthereumStratum/2.0.0) should endorse strict JsonRpc 2.0 specs (https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) and have been specified at this document https://github.com/AndreaLanfranchi/EthereumStratum-2.0.0

Funding of this project will guarantee the existence of a free and open-source miner for Ethereum.

This is Ken from Project Galaxy. Project Galaxy is a NaaS (NFT-as-a-service) infrastructure that empowers everyone to utilize NFT to build on-chain credentials. We believe that community management is key to decentralized organizations and NFTs can be a perfect medium to power on-chain achievements and credentials. 

After talking with the Gitcoin team, we want to share our plan here with all of you. 

How Can Project Galaxy Help Gitcoin:
Galaxy Protocol contains plug-and-play modules that allow communities to create customized NFT-powered campaigns based on their needs. With our V1 launch, we recommend three campaign templates for Gitcoin to kick off their NFT journey:

Background Story Ideas for the NFT Collection
We believe Gitcoin is the future, so we recommend a brand story similar to building a futuristic Gundam. Community members can participate in different campaigns to collect base model NFTs, Wing NFTs, and Weapon NFTs. Eventually, users will be able to collect all the parts and forge them into limited-edition sick-looking complete Gundam Model NFTs.

- Campaign for Bounties - Mission 1
Reward those who actively use the Bounties feature.
NFT Collection: Gundam base model NFTs
Rules:
Users who have submit X bounties will be in the whitelist of claiming the corresponding amount of mystery boxes.
Each mystery box will give you one random NFT out of the three.

- Campaign for Grants - Mission 2
Reward those who have funded Grants.
NFT Collection: Wing NFTs
Rules:
Users who have funded XXX worth of assets to any grants will be in the whitelist of claiming 2/4/6 mystery boxes.
Each mystery box will give you one random NFT out of the three.

- Campaign for Quests - Mission 3
Reward those who actively use the Quests feature.
NFT Collection: Weapon NFTs
Rules:
Users who have posted X quests will be in the whitelist of claiming the corresponding amount of mystery boxes.
Each mystery box will give you one random NFT out of the three.

Forging Campaign (Will be announced in stage 2)

Want to learn more live demos? Visit https://galaxy.eco


Such Achievement-based NFT Campaigns Can Help Gitcoin with
Stronger branding through the issuance of customized NFTs
Better form of rewards that inspires community members’ ownership
Create something fun to increase community engagement and retention
Promote governance and protocol usage through NFT gamification
Identify long-term and core contributors in the community


What’s Next? 
We will be launching Galaxy V1 and the first set of Gitcoin NFT campaigns soon. While we gather initial feedback from community members through these campaigns, we will be preparing for the next set of Gitcoin campaigns that aim to reward community members that contribute to different parts of the Gitcoin ecosystem.
In the long run, we expect more community members can be more directly involved in the process of campaign/design creation. We are really excited to work alongside the Gitcoin community on this.
Please don’t hesitate to comment under this post or on the Gitcoin channel of Project Galaxy Discord. Looking forward to hearing your feedback!


Funding Request
We are requesting $20k-50K in ETH. 20% of the funds will be used to cover the development cost. The rest will be packaged into NFTs to users who successfully claim the NFTs.

548,togedao-a-forum-and-social-media-community-built-,"How togeDAO Works?

Unlike any other social network, togeDAO is based on the Ethereum blockchain, which allows it to be run in a decentralized manner. This means there is and no data abuse, no censorship, no central authority, no downtime, no data vulnerability. 

It solves a seemingly-endless list of problems seen in centralized social platforms (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, etc.). 
As well as the above unique advantages, it also rewards its users using cryptocurrency! So, rather than post to social media, while the central party (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) cash in on ad revenue, you can post to social media and be paid for it yourself.

That is, all the content posted on togeDAO is stored in the Ethereum blockchain and cannot be removed by any central authority like in the case of Twitter and Facebook. Its regulated/moderated by the users to prevent plagiarism, illicit content, and other unnecessary/useless content.

There’s a reward system where forum discussions, content creators and curators are paid out which, in theory, should be based on the value they add to the platform. The platform uses TOGE, ETH and DAI to reward both content creators as well as curators who can upvote, downvote, comment, and flag posts.
1. TOG – Our tradable cryptocurrency (utility token) that you can 	exchange for DAI or ETH, buy and sell on exchanges. 
2. The stable cryptocurrency, designed to be pegged to DAI, that serves as a way for content contributors to know exactly how much they are getting paid. It can be traded with ETH or TOG and can be transferred to other accounts.


How Are The Users Paid On togeDAO?

The way togeDAO comes up with these tokens to reward users is simply by creating them. Unlike bitcoin, the tokens are already pre mined, and each year they inflate the supply to have more tokens to distribute.
Everyday togeDAO rewards 100% of the new TOG units to the people who paid to the content creators, curators, and commenters.

The payout reward for each post is as follows:
§ At least 80% of the amount goes to the author of the thread or content.
§ At most 20% is distributed among the curators.
The thread owner’s job is to write a topic that they think will add value.
The curator’s job is to then vote on the content based on how good they think it is. To try to keep it somewhat of a meritocracy, togeDAO will create clever ways of incentivizing curators to vote only on quality content.

Incentivizing
togeDAO is trying to change how social media platforms work. Unlike platforms like Facebook where users are not compensated financially for the content they create, togeDAO rewards the platform’s contributors/creators’ directly with its togeDAO coin at the end of every week.

Creators and curators play a central role on this blockchain-based platform which rewards the users for their contributions.
In addition to creators, curators are also a very important part of the togeDAO community. Users who upvote and help evaluate the quality of content are called “curators” on togeDAO.
In fact, curators are also rewarded on togeDAO as they help in maintaining the quality of the content! 
That’s what togeDAO and decentralization are all about — the power is in the community’s hands.

Like Reddit, togeDAO relies on its community to self-enforce the guidelines for user behavior. We are going to develop a community moderation guides called togeCops
A few important points that are emphasized by togeDAO are:
· Citing sources and giving credit is encouraged.
· There is a lot of emphasis on rewarding the original creator so original content is preferred when it comes to giving out rewards.

· Avoid rewarding undesirable and spammy content.
The idea is to create a genuinely decentralized platform where users themselves decide which content is valuable, how good behavior should be incentivized, and how to create and maintain a positive community.


How Does togeDAO Make Money?

togeDAO uses the following ways to earn money.
One of the ways togeDAO makes money is when its users pays ETH so their posts can be seen by a larger audience, thus getting more votes which translates into higher daily incentives. Theoretically we will use that ETH as an investment in the platform by which they can make a larger return than what they’re giving back with rewards.
Additionally, our tradable TOG token will appreciate in value, which will bring in a source of cash for the platform or reinvested back in the business.
togeDAO also allows its users to promote their posts to reach a larger audience. togeDAO has its own built-in way to promote each post. This is not unlike other decentralized platforms such as Minds, which also allows users to boost posts this way as well. Think of it like a Twitter Ad, your essentially paying for people to see your content, hoping that will convert to sales for your business, or in this case, upvotes and earning potential for your post.

We have no explicit ads, but you can imagine each post as a single advertisement. In order to attract attention or “sell the contents”, a user should invest his money. If people like their post and they will get their money back and even earn something.

What is togeDAO Token (TOG)
TOG, stable one. It is intended to be valued 1:1 with DAI, which means that 1 TOG should be equal to the amount of DAI that can be bought with 1 USD.
As TOGs are intended to be stable, 70% of the payment to creators and curators on togeDAO is processed in TOG . TOG will be listed on several exchanges.
You can cash out your TOG by converting it to DAI or ETH on the in-built mini exchange or converting it to fiat currency.
Also by holding TOG, you earn a 10% annual interest.

Investment Description
Our short description of business was started to address a demand for more blockchain incentivized community.
We understand that we operate in what can be a competitive field, so the aim to outcompete similar businesses by offering :
1. A simple, easy and better UX 
2. Straight forward mode of payment with a pegged token that will be as stable as the DAI token
3. Fully decentralized reward community.
This makes us unique in the industry and gives us a strong competitive advantage.

Summary
We genuinely believe that togeDAO has huge potential in the Ethereum blockchain. Our team has proven expertise, including relevant experience. To add to this, our unique approach makes togeDAO a powerful force in the dapp chain.
With our predicted future growth, we are offering you a valuable investment opportunity.

Background:
Non-Fungible Tokens are set to radicalize how value interoperates across the digital landscape of media in the new Web 3.0 version of the internet. These unique assets span across video games, blockchain domains, mixed reality, representing a claim on physical assets, and even as decentralized identities. 

Why doe NFTs exist? Our world is entropy-driven information chaos. Protocols like NFTs enable the scalability of value by constraining optionality with order. The most important dualism to understand: freedom vs. constraint of progress. NFTs restore order, while maximizing creative potential after certain periods of crypto market appreciation. The reason being, is that in order to maximize our community net-value, shifting between order and chaos is key for long team gain to maximize a communities collective points of optimums in the world of the metaverse.

Natural Entropy & the Importance of Attention
In the universe, the natural rate of entropy tends to increase, which is exactly what we saw in early crypto — i.e. many different teams go off and build in their own directions to compete for investor, developer, and user attention. But, reversions occur.

The more order and simplicity in our lives, the less bandwidth collectively spent on complex things. Whether as a user — e.g. private keys, navigating wallets, collectibles, & tokens — or, a developer — e.g. shifting to building on various protocols. By creating order in new forms of using media, NFTs represent “Structure preserving Transformations” in our digital world. https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/04/06/deep-laziness/

Possible Futures
Operations + Moderation Help
Operating the sub-reddit is meant to accomplish just this, like a central curated hub of NFTs and information. With such power of decentralized media, attentive moderation is required to ensure the health and culture of the community.

AMAs & Discussion
Reaching out to names to perform AMAs on recent drops, ethical conversations, and futures of the NFT community. Currently you are seeing this on Clubhouse, but we believe there to be privacy concerns with identity, whereby more precise thought and socratic debate and can be openly discussed.

Technical
Invest in resources for L2 off-chain for Reddit & Ethereum integrations for NFT embedding & in posts, providing a possible source of Identity & Wallets within reddit (following examples from r/ethTrader). Future integrations with Gitcoin + Reddit as a possible integration mechanism for OSS project minting.

Also, they likely only tested their own products and didn't compare them vs. their competitors' products. Thus, many people take supplements that may not work. This wastes time and money and potentially even harms people's health.



Solution: We will perform a full panel of healthspan and lifespan measurements in mice on many of the most popular health-promoting supplements. Animals are valuable for longevity research because they are bred to be genetically highly similar to each other especially in comparison to humans. This genetic similarity is important because it makes the results more consistent, such that reliable conclusions are more likely to be drawn from them. Thus, we are addressing the problem of the lack of rigorous studies in humans by using a more controlled experimental model system. The mouse healthspan toolbox we'll use was assembled by leading longevity scientists including Dudley Lamming and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin. We will also measure the effects of the supplements on the well-validated epigenetic clock in human cells.

Who is the team behind Supplements Death Match? 

Our team is led by Tim Peterson, Ph.D. and Sandeep Kumar, Ph.D. Dr. Peterson is an Assistant Professor at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis in the Departments of Medicine and Genetics. “WashU” is a perennially top five medical school in the U.S. in terms of publishing and funding. Dr. Peterson did his Ph.D. at MIT where he published multiple papers in Nature, Science, and Cell journal on one of the major aging pathways, mTOR, and the drug, rapamycin, that targets it. Dr. Peterson did his postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University where he continued his work on longevity drug mechanisms focusing on the most commonly used drugs for osteoporosis, bisphosphonates and diabetes, metformin. Dr. Kumar similarly has a deep background in aging research most notably performing several seminal lifespan studies in worms.

CoBox is an open source project enabling easy **and** secure deployment of P2P cloud infrastructures. All of our technology is modular and scriptable; usable as standalone components or through an interface. The modular software and optional hardware box can turn a hard drive into a secure cloud with the help of friends, peers and organizations. Imagine a space for your data that has the convenience of the corporate cloud (DropBox, Google Drive) and the privacy of self-hosting (Nextcloud) but without needing to accept surveillance or be a sysadmin. CoBox offers that space by leveraging modern cryptography and innovations in P2P technologies.

* Think a decentralized google drive that is hosted on a teams laptops.

The CoBox business model will be Infrastructure as a Service (like AWS, without Jeff Bezos owning everything). Whilst the base CoBox stack is FOSS and free to use, in future people will be able to pay for access to the platform and registry of users to get additional services:

* automated backups
* exchange of data space
* data services related to GDPR (Data Protection Officer as a Service, etc)

The CoBox platform will not just be data storage, it will also be a data economy. It will:

1. Replace the corporate cloud
Because CoBox offers better privacy, it will appeal to those sensitive to privacy concerns with google drive and amazon S3.
Because CoBox offers more flexibility, it will appeal to developers who would like to customize it to create P2P applications of their own. 
2. Appeal to a large early adopter market of people unhappy with the overreach of the corporate cloud
Because CoBox as FOSS offers a zero cost modality, it will appeal to early adopters and users with cost structures that prohibit service fees.
3. Be the service for freelancers who currently overspend on hard-drives and worry constantly about data loss
Because CoBox stores data replicated across groups, it offers better resilience than most solutions, and will appeal to groups of users who cannot afford to lose data to a centralized server or cloud
4. Be the platform for data professionals to offer their services to a primed and growing digital economy market.

Team
CoBox is built by a multidisciplinary team with a combined 50+ years experience in open source technology, trust based networks and digital cooperatives. We are experienced in human centric design, non extractive business, privacy enhancing technologies and delivering immediate value to users. We are all experienced in effective remote collaboration and know how to work as a team. We are a high-EQ group, emphasising the human elements of what it takes to make great software, backed up by socio-technical expertise.

CoBox is a best-in-class project supported by the LEDGER Venture Builder in 2019/20 receiving the full $225k USD to build a functioning MVP. LEDGER is part of The Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, which was launched by the European Commission and it aims to shape the future internet as a value-centric and interoperable ecosystem that embodies openness, inclusivity, transparency, privacy, cooperation, and protection of data.

1151,fuzzing-home-helping-find-bugs-in-eth-20-clients,"Hi all,

i've been an Etherean since nov 2016, and i recently decided to throw my hat in the ring and take a more proactive role, helping ensure a successful transition to eth2.0.
I work in IT and when i stumbled upon BeaconFuzz, the amazing fuzzing tool developed by the Sigma Prime guys, a community run Fuzzing framework targeting various eth2.0 clients i knew i had to give it a try.
This initiative aims to harness computational resources(CPU cycles mainly) from participants in the quest to find potential bugs and security vulnerabilities in the various eth2.0 clients in order to harden the network and make the entire project more resilient to attacks. They recently updated the tool to be able to detect discrepancies between clients that could manifest as consensus issues(structural differential fuzzing),this will greatly reduce the risk of consensus bugs affecting phase 0 mainnet.The differential fuzzer has also recently added support for Teku and a new custom version written in Rust is being developed by Sigma Prime to increase speed and optimize coverage.

The tool is not exceedingly hard to use but it is very resource intensive(with the latest update it requires ~10GiB of RAM per instance)  and needs to be run 24/7 to have a decent coverage and be of any real benefit.To this end i have been fuzzing on a remote VPS with 8 cores/8GB ram and on an Odroid H2+, small SBC(single board computer) that i acquired specifically for this purpose.

https://imgur.com/a/W62wtqc

So far i have managed to uncover and report 5 bugs that have been confirmed and fixed: 

Overflow/underflow in ProposerSlashing processing
Failed val->IsArrayBufferView assertion when parsing invalid ENR string 
crash-2cf82c9a6bf1e6e9e0609d767f4ea582defd9cf3 in proposer_slashing (not exploitable)
crash-04bf9c907f05466a1bf0d9f203f30dacb2f19703 in attestation (consensus bug)
crash-8aca1b5ce295f678fb67bd5ea8bb36c13a0d7f20 in struct_proposer_slashing (not exploitable)

Apart from the above bugs i also reported several minor miscellaneous issues and bugs in the fuzzer itself.

I will be fuzzing 24/7 until phase 0 mainnet and hopefully if the EF sees value in the project and Sigma Prime keeps maintaining it i will be dedicating time and resources to it in perpetuity.

I plan to build a small cluster of passively cooled Odroid H2+ boards to aid in the fuzzing effort as they are low cost and have a small power envelope and physical footprint that is well suited to be run at scale in a home environment (i'm also evaluating the GMK NucBox and the Asus PN50 4800U).

I'm only doing this because i love Ethereum and its community and will keep at it regardless, nonetheless any tips to recoup hardware/electricity expenses and time invested are very much appreciated.

UPDATE:
Phase 0 is finally live and we couldn't have hoped for a smoother genesis but the battle to squash lingering bugs and prevent new ones from being introduced doesn't end here.
Thanks to your amazing support i expanded the fuzzing setup described above and i am now running 3 cloud instances of the fuzzer together with 3 boxes in my home lab.
here are updated pics:
https://imgur.com/a/cXq7RC3
The fuzzers will be kept operational and thanks to the continued development efforts by the Sigma Prime team i'm sure more bugs will be found and new parts of the stack such as networking will be integrated and also undergo the same relentless fuzzing regimen.
Thanks!

579,the-trojan-dao,"The Trojan DAO is a Decentralised Autonomous Organization that began operating in Athens, Greece in the summer of 2019.


Th context within which we launched is that in recent years Athens has seen a proliferation of alternative art spaces and initiatives, perhaps an unforeseen result of challenging recent experiences of austerity crisis and capital controls, and the resulting reduced role of commercial art spaces. The conditions have pushed for new practices: Making structures that are co-managed and operated by artists themselves according to our needs, and that are transparent, cannot be sensored and can operate beyond borders, all the more important. 

Let's do things differently!
Now is the time to step up our efforts and transform the challenges that we face into new opportunities! 

To find ways to better sustain autonomous art practices there needs to be an update to our basic mechanisms of collective decision-making and sharing of common resources, where the slow to adapt bureaucracies of the past are replaced by creativity, the power of ideas, and rituals of collectivity.  

Art isn't created in a void - The ideas that guide us is that together we can achieve more than the sum of our parts, that culture is a collaborative process, and that we are interdependent on eachother's efforts.

We keep in context that the technology, despite all the new potentials that it offers, does not replace commonality of experience and our networks of mutual trust that we build on, with the understanding that we should not expect solutions for grassroots empowerment in art to come from within the established systems, but rather they can be cultivated through the active involvement of those who use them.

For the Trojan DAO, all who participate are it’s curators. Each one of us has a creative potential. To express, explore and develop this potential, by finding new ways to strengthen the connections between us as a community of creators is the purpose of the Trojan DAO.

Projects to date:

ArborVote: We are conducting hacking sessions and offering support for the open-source development of this project - to bring decision making through deliberative democracy based on argument trees to the blockchain.

Our Mission:


To collectively organise cultural events that express our ideas and artistic imperatives. To create a resilient grassroots ecosystem for art, that brings together artist run initiatives, patrons and others together to participate in building the art world we want to be part of.

To create a new collaborative framework for our art and our ideas to reach out beyond borders, creating ways to support each-other, to more effectively coordinate resources towards achieving shared goals. 

To explore blockchain technologies as a new artistic medium and organizational tool, encouraging interdisciplirary collaborations and cross-education, bringing abstract tools to tangible outcomes, and raising awareness around decentralised practices for art and activism.

With allcryptowhitepapers.com I've become the largest cryptocurrency whitepaper database, and by doing so my website has also become the only place online where you can find every crypto whitepaper, even from abandoned projects. I have more whitepaper PDFs than coinmarketcap.com and coingecko.com combined, and am committed to keep collecting them.

Apart from building my whitepaper archive, I've written many articles on whitepaper research and how to DYOR before investing in crypto. 

To expand my reach, keep spreading the DYOR-word and to keep constantly updating my whitepaper database I could use some funds to help me achieve my goals of growth, and in the progress help me monetize the site more and stay committed to keep building my database.

I am asking for this grant because after 3 years of building and collecting whitepapers, I haven't succeeded in monetizing the website properly enough to make it worth the time I've spent on building the whitepaper archive. Those 2850+ whitepapers are at the moment the most valuable asset in my company, so I'm asking a grant in return for donating my dataset to the (github) community and improve the site and it's reach along the way.

We plan to inform musicians and their fans for opportunities that are evolving through the open source space and the Ethereum ecosystem.Educate them about the problems of ownership, payments and transparency.Protect them from middlemen, improve the income of the artists and reduce the cost for listeners to access music.

The first project that Beatnomads.art are going to work is to create a mechanism that rewards early supporters through a bonding curve token.

The idea is that when someone buys a record from a band he scans a QR code and claims some tokens. The quantity of tokens that you claim is correlated based on how many people have all ready scan the QR. For example the first take 100 token the second 80 etc.

This tokens then can be sold or give access to premium content or sell it back to them and take some money back.

In the long term we will organize lessons and online meetups for open source music tools,educate artists for the new opportunities that occurred from the Blockchain space, buy and provide the equipment for online or live dj sets and concerts, create trust between artists and fans and create new ways for fans to support their favourite artists.

As musicians we want to help ourselves and other people like us to corporate and give to our audience the best experience we can with a way that we help the music industry in general.


Our organization will give support on this subjects:
Creating music.
Help artists to find the right tools to raise money.
Provide recording and mixing support.
Help them monetize their work and interact directly with their fans.
Educate artists about Open source tools that they can use for creating their music.
Educate them about how token economics, DAOs and Dapps can help them.
Provide technical support for web developing and SEO for better ranking on google.
Provide hardware support for online events.
Help artists to create content.
Help artists to record Dj sessions on beautiful locations in Greece.
Help artists to connect with other DAOs that can support them and have social impact.

2316,datatoken-open-marketplace-for-decentralized-data,"Almost everyday you open mobile applications like twitter and Amazon, for getting convenient services. However, you lose your data ownership in the era of data economy. You cannot control how your data is shared and sold, while service-matching platforms make huge profits from it and determine what you can see. So, our vision is to make the data flows more transparent and rebuild the service-matching schema in Web3. 

What is DataToken?

DataToken SDK implements a new decentralized data management and off-chain trusted computing middleware. It leverages the trusted features of blockchains to return data ownership to its owners while maintaining the computability and traceability of data. This is also a special use case of NFTs applied in data sharing and monetization. Data assets can be defined once but sold multiple times for private computation.

How Does It Work?

This projects provide asset templates for data owners to define how data can be computed. So for data owners, instead of giving away data, they can maintain control of data, and have the choice to monetize it. DApps can create data unions to aggregate authorized datasets, e.g., a batch of user preferences or service features of NFTs. Data buyers can directly purchase aggregated data for computation, e.g., building NFT recommender systems.



Specifically,  DataToken is a new data service specification for traceable computation and hierarchical aggregation. Data owners can declare a permitted list of trusted operators and related constraints in the data service terms. Anyone who wants to use the source data must fulfill all service terms and get authorization for computation.

Play with It

Data owners could sell the data computing rights in the marketplace. and data buyers could execute remote jobs for data analysis.  You can search the lifecycle of data through the DataTracer.

💸Financial fraud
💳Identity theft
🎣Cyber crime

My reports reach:

➡The affected companies / organizations being targeted;
➡The affected companies, who provide services for the fraudsters to use like VPS hosting, Domain registration, SSL/TLS certificate issuing and the likes;
➡The responsible authorities like the IC3 institute, NSA, Interpol, European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), Europol or the concrete anti cyber division for the particular country.

I also use twitter for additional exposure, awareness and engagement with the affected companies.
I am aware that one sole person can barely make a difference, but the combined efforts of many contributors have a cumulative impact!

I do this in my free time.
If you like my work can support me here!

In my opinion it is pretty unfair that some companies are willing to pay millions of dollars worth of crypto to cyber criminals after an ransomware incident, but in the same time people like me who proacively invest their free time to protect brands and users alike get little to no grants whatsoever.
I am really passionate about shutting cyber-crime down and I know how to hunt bad guys online. I truly believe that what I do has significant value and is yet to be recognized.

112,devcon-scholars-program,"Introductory Note
Hey! My name is Robby Greenfield and I’m helping to organize this year’s Devcon Scholars Program. Our team is very excited to introduce more elements to the initiative in the hope of providing an opportunity that extends beyond visiting Osaka, Japan for passionate individuals that wouldn’t otherwise get a chance to attend Devcon. All donations to this grant will go to the Ethereum Foundation to help subsidize our scholarship budget, and hopefully increase the number of scholarships we provide. As a form of social stake, you can learn more about my background here.
 
From the Ethereum Foundation’s call to sponsors:
 
As wonderful as the Ethereum community is, it has inherited the lack of diversity that is unfortunately very commonplace in tech. The result is a less colorful world, a more limited perspective, and a less resilient industry. The Devcon Scholars Program aims to expand the Ethereum community by bringing more people to experience Devcon’s unique atmosphere and opportunities, and make sure that a lack of money or access doesn’t keep extraordinary people from making their mark.
 
This program seeks to provide scholarships to people who couldn't otherwise experience the event. In 2018, 37 scholars came to the Czech Republic to experience what it means to be a part of the Ethereum community. The program inspired a world of firsts that encouraged scholars to be more active in the community and bring their own perspectives along the way. 
 
This year, the program is growing. In addition to the continued goal of increasing the diversity of the Ethereum community until it reflects the diversity of the human race, there will be more targeted education and engagement in order to make sure that scholars get as much out of the experience as possible. In 2019, the Devcon Scholars Program will focus on the following:
	
Diversity and Inclusion - Ensuring that people who couldn’t typically attend Devcon have the opportunity to do so. In particular, our team is focusing on candidates who are:
From lower-income backgrounds
Female and/or non-binary 
Ethnically and/or geographically underrepresented at previous Devcon events

Engagement - Educate scholars about blockchain technology, connect them with mentors in the ecosystem, encourage them to engage with Ethereum’s unique problem spaces, and facilitate professional connections.
 
Empowerment - The Devcon Scholars program wants participants to take what they’ve learned from the experience back to their communities and apply those learnings toward helping the ecosystem grow. Scholars will leave with:
A Devcon Scholar Certificate, stored on the Ethereum blockchain
Multi-media documentation of their experience, at their own discretion, both as a keepsake and for future professional reference

The Ethereum Foundation is able to support a finite number of scholars through the general Devcon budget and additional contributions from sponsors, but we’re hoping to increase that total through community funding as well. Every contribution counts, and we would be extremely grateful if you would consider contributing to help deeply change the lives of Scholars! Contributions made through the Gitcoin grant will be donated to the Ethereum Foundation; all proceeds will go to expand the scholarship program.

2854,zang,"zang is an on-chain text NFT platform.

Many cryptoartists want to tokenize text-based NFTs. Since almost every platform is focused on images, they usually have to tokenize a picture with text on it.
We want to build a platform that explicitly focuses on text in order to support this type of cryptoart.

Roadmap
We plan to initially support Markdown, first as an open-beta testnet and then on mainnet.
As soon as that is implemented, the focus will shift to HTML+CSS, which would allow a greater degree of freedom.

Since using IPFS carries some risks, we aim to store NFTs entirely on-chain. In order to minimize the gas cost (and environmental impact) of this choice, we plan to use L2 solutions (such as Arbitrum, Optimism or Immutable X).

Team
We are Luca Donno and Samuele Marro, two CS students at University of Bologna. Luca is a cryptoartist since 2019, mainly on KnownOrigin and Art Blocks, and a crypto enthusiast since 2018. Samuele, on the other hand, is a student ML researcher at Istituto di Studi Superiori (Bologna), but is an almost complete newbie to the NFT world. Together, we authored Green NFTs: A Study on the Environmental Impact of Cryptoart Technologies, as part of Artnome's GreenNFT hackathon. After this paper, we decided to shift our focus from writing about existing NFT platforms to creating a new one.

Send via Airdrop, Leave for Will Call, or Issue Transferable Tickets.

No fees except gas. Send directly to wallets or allow recipients to claim.

MAKE IT RAIN NFTS!

Frequently Asked Questions
Q: What is Nifty Cannon?
A: Nifty Cannon is public good utility for sending one or more NFTs to one or more recipients. It is maintained by Futurescale, Inc., a US, Delaware-based corporation.

Q: What does it cost to use?
A: Nifty Cannon (this app and its public smart contract) collects no fees. 
   However, there is a gas cost associated with any Ethereum transaction.
   The gas cost of any given interaction with Nifty Cannon varies as a function of network congestion, prevailing gas prices, and the strategy chosen for sending and/or receiving at will call.

Q: How do I send Nifties?
A: There are several ways to send NFTs using Nifty Cannon. Currently, those are: Airdrop, Will Call, and Transferable Ticket.

Q: What is an Airdrop?
A: The sender pays all of the gas required for transferring their NFTs directly to the recipients. 
   Sender approves the Nifty Cannon to transfer the nifties, then removes the approval afterward.
   Recipients need not interact with Nifty Cannon, the NFTs will simply appear in their wallets.

Q: What is Will Call?
A: The sender specifies the NFTs and recipients, then approves the Nifty Cannon contract to do transfers.
   Recipients must then sign in with their wallet to pick up or reject the waiting nifties, paying gas for any transfers.
   The recipient wallet address must be the same address specified by the sender.

Q: What is a Transferable Ticket?
A: Transferable tickets are similar to Will Call, except an NFT representing the ticket is minted and sent to the recipient.
   The recipient may burn, sell, or transfer that ticket to someone else's wallet.
   Only the current owner of the ticket can pick up the waiting nifties.

It is the perfect digital substitute of the wall that decomplexify the act of collecting artworks made in the street.

In our mission to build Wallkanda, we have come to realize that some of the tools we are building would be useful to the whole NFT community, which is why we decided to open source them and create a grant to help us continue development.
As we are more and more tools we will keep this page up-to-date.

Collab Splitter
Our first tool, Collab Splitter, is an open decentralized registry for anyone in need of an easy way to split payments.

This very simple dApp allow for more collaboration and social impact by empowering individuals, creators, and organizations to work and support one another in a fair and transparent way.
Collaboration between street artists happens often as murals can be very large, a whole building or street is painted or through cultural events. It is one of our most requested features from artists.

Either as 1) split the recipient on collab artworks sales or 2) as the recipient of royalties send with the new ""NFT Royalty Standard"", Collab Splitter allows to create a cheap contract in charge of receiving and splitting Ethereum and ERC20 payments.

403,swap-box,"What is SwapBox
SwapBox is an open source software and hardware project for a fully decentralized cash and crypto ATM, not attached to any centralized exchange or server.
Enable the confidentiality and integrity of money for all
Help unbanked people get into crypto through a fully decentralized way
Let anyone run a crypto ATM business without headache
Build a fairer financial system where users decide the future of the tools they use.
Where it all comes from (short story)
SwapBox's origins date back to 2014, with the desire and mission to restore the privacy and integrity of money for all.
Under the name ATM4COIN, I created a first prototype in wood, on the Litecoin network, with only the cash-in function.
Soon after, I met Samouraid3 aka Atola, who would become a friend. He was very excited about the project and wanted to contribute. He made a round trip to New Delhi and surprised me when, instead of luggage, he came back with a new box. The first metal prototype was born. We quickly realized the weaknesses of our prototype: poor user experience, a centralized backend and many reliability and security issues. For these reasons, the project went on hiatus and back to the drawing board.

Atola prototype - graffiti by Lif of the Bench Crew Family
In 2019, the rise of Uniswap and the xCHF stablecoin allowed us to work on a fully decentralized version which we demoed at Web3Summit and ETHBerlin, and try to solve the reliability and security issues. At that time, the following problems remained:
High speed connection required (eth node)
Cash out difficult & slow due to confirmation process
The congestion of the Ethereum network made the machine unusable (high gas cost)
We were stuck but not discouraged. We knew that innovations would come along that would help us solve our problems. In early 2020, we discovered zkSync, a zero-knowledge layer 2 proof-of-validity rollup for the Ethereum network. This new technology allows us to solve our main problems:
No need to run a full Ethereum node
Instant (economic) finality for cash-out
Minimise gas fees
So now, we are planning to have a fully working product soon after the launch of the zkSync 2.0 mainnet.
Where is the project at
SwapBox
We are now working on building a strong brand identity and a website.
Software
Currently, we are working on the zkSync version, writing new contracts with Zinc, redesigning the UI/UX of the software.
We are also working on a setup wizard to greatly simplify the installation for the operator of the machine. This is crucial: we need to reduce friction to a minimum to have a maximum adoption.
Hardware
At the moment, we have an ATM design we are happy with, but it is still subject to change. We are still working on a first prototype of that latest design. When we will be certain on the final design, we will make step-by-step instructions as easy as building Scandinavian style furniture :)
How is SwapBox different
SwapBox will be different to other crypto ATM by many aspects :
Different by design
The plans of the machine, the software and the list of the necessary third party equipment will be free to use and open-source. This means that anyone will be able to build their own machines, as well as modify them as they wish.
Cash-crypto swaps will be executed on an AMM aggregator (TBD) on zkSync, and each machine will belong to each operator. This makes SwapBox a completely decentralized system by design, making it more reliable and easier to maintain in a self sovereign way, with the only requirement being an internet connection & at least 12v of power (under ~2 amps standby, ~6 amps peak).
Using a DEX allows the operator to completely bypass bank infrastructure. (Many crypto ATM setups force the operators to rely on banks to transfer the cash to a bank account, then to a centralized exchange and then the crypto wallet used to serve users.)
Different by governance
The end goal of SwapBox is delegate the governance of the project to the user community. The design of the project will allow us to experiment with novel governance mechanisms, tokenization schemes and/or other emergent crypto systems.
Different by anti-fragility
As SwapBox will not be a single entity, each problem (hacks, vulnerability) that occurs on a SwapBox won't have an impact on other SwapBox directly, but the solution to solve the issue could apply to every SwapBox. In this sense, SwapBox is anti-fragile.
What are the plans for the future
SwapBox's final objective is to delegate the governance of the project to the users, i.e. the software updates, but also the manufacturing of the machines. In order to limit transportation costs and ecological impact, the ATM design will be simple enough to be delivered in kit form and built by the machine operator himself.
But before that, the plans for the future are:
Finish the software for the zkSync rollup
Improve the existing UI/UX
Integrate an AMM aggregator on zkSync to replace Uniswap
Create a GUI setup wizard
Add dynamic fee pricing to promote automatic rebalancing of cash reserves
Add lightning network support (RGB)
Other ideas:
Tokenize machine ownership/revenue share
Reward tokens for users of machine, acting as a governance token

SwapBox v4.0 concept
Why a Gitcoin Grant
As you probably know, funding open source projects is hard, especially as we don't want any speculative investing, such as the ICO mania in 2017. So we are using Gitcoin Grants to help us partially fund the project.
Since our product is not only software, but also a physical product, we have other costs in addition to the ""traditional"" design and development costs:
Freelance product designer wage
Prototype production costs
Transportation costs

NEWS: SBT

Having your own reviews protected by a seed phrase poses some risks.
What if you lose access to the keys? All your reviews will still be onchain, but linked to dead listings (for which you lost the seed).
For this reason we are now exploring the SBT space and betting on its development.
With SBTs, the identity layer will be more resilient and forgiving.
Hosts/Hotels will have a way to get back access to them.


OPEN REVIEWS

Think Uniswap for reputation.
This protocol will allow you to replicate your existing reviews from centralised Web2 platforms, like Airbnb or Booking, towards Web3, with an open and unstoppable replication protocol.
Back them up in case your account gets suspended, these companies abuse their position or you simply want to migrate your reputation to web3.

Why?

Reviews are very valuable, they are the currency of trust.
Guests write them for the Hosts but the platforms capture them, and they are then ""siloed"" for the platforms own business use.

Reviews Are Locked in

Who should really own a review?

The person who wrote it?
The person who received it?
The platform which hosts it?

Today they belong to the platform which acted as a facilitator.
We don’t think this is right.


People and Businesses Are Locked in

A person/business reputation is locked into the platforms.

If you are a Host and decide to stop using Airbnb or the account terminated, your reviews remain there and become basically useless.

You have worked years to accumulate them.
You went out of your way to accommodate the guests for those reviews.
You did this because they are valuable to you. 
You are being held to ransom but did all the work.

And yet, you can’t take them with you.

Without your listing, the reviews have no value to the platforms. 
And yet they keep them.

The platforms didn’t write them.
The reviews are about your listing and your service.
The Guests wrote the review for you.

Yet the platforms keep them.
They’ll sit on some backup server and nobody will ever see them again.
All those years of reputation and brand building are effectively gone.

They rather destroy them than allow you to export them and use them elsewhere.

The same thing happens when you get “deplatformed” (your account is shut down): you lose years of work with no recourse.

And what if you are a Guest with many great reviews?
You won't be able to use them in other platforms effectively needing to build your reputation from scratch every time you create an account in a new platform.

Unlock Your Reputation

We believe you should be able to own your reputation.
Your reviews, if you choose so, should be publicly available on the blockchain for everyone to read and embed in websites, apps and everywhere else.

This could theoretically be done by scraping them, saving them on a server and giving open access to everyone.
In this way unfortunately they'd lose the credibility because the Guests may ask:
- Who exported the reviews?
- Are these just the good ones?
- Were they manipulated?
Also, the server would still belong to one company alongside its costs and business model.
The company will need to make money.

Backup The Reviews On The Blockchain

With this project we want to unlink the reviews from the platforms lock in.

We will create a decentralised, unstoppable protocol.
The scraping will be done automatically with open source distributed software so that everyone can verify the reviews saved on the blockchain are the originals.
We will develop a decentralised interface where each user can initiate the export and pay for the gas to write the hash on the Ethereum blockchain and the content on IPFS.
They insert the link of the listing, pay the gas and obtain a URL where they can see their reviews saved on the blockchain.

Done! They saved their reviews forever.
No one can take them away now.

Immutability

Users can only instruct the system to take ALL reviews from a listing, as they are.
They can’t edit them, hide the negative ones or do anything which undermines their veracity.

Visitors will see the reviews exactly as they are on the originating platforms.

This is the new paradigm of Reputation: immutable, open and verifiable.
 

Embed Them Everywhere

Once they are online, they can be embedded in a direct booking website for free (no gas required to read).
Each review links to the original listing in order to make it easier for anyone to check (i.e. ""see this review in Expedia"").

Other platforms can use them.

Reputation Replication to Web3

These protocols will allow the replication of more than a decade of reputation to Web3.
We start with vacation rentals but anyone can build on top of it and serve other verticals (Amazon, Google etc…).
The unlocked value is enormous.
It will increase the value and usability of the decentralised internet by many orders of magnitude.
It will also speed up the adoption of Dapps as they get populated with Web2 reviews and while the Web3 native reviews start picking up.

A Simple Interface

Users won’t need to learn much about Web3.
The most advanced ones will use a wallet like Metamask.
Others may prefer solutions like Portis with credit card payments of gas.
Third party companies will be free to offer the possibility to no-coiners to pay in advance for the gas in fiat and applying meta transactions so that they can interact with the blockchain and don’t worry about gas.

Economics

We may decide introduce a protocol fee to fund development.
This will be decided in the research phase.
If we go this way, here's a possible scenario:
The smart contract charges an ETH fee according to the number of listings (or some other metric).
This fee covers the initial gas and maybe a certain number of updates (reviews are added all the time) + a fee.
The fee goes in a DAO smart contract (based on Aragon, Daostack or others) and is managed by the DAO itself to pay for development, research and auditing.
A native token is not necessary.

Who We Are

We are Trips Community, a blockchain project born in 2017, and our aim is to build a completely decentralized booking platform.

We are vacation rentals veterans, and have been in this space long before Airbnb, Booking.com or Expedia.
Blockchain early adopters, we have been accepting Cryptocurrencies for bookings since 2013.

Amongst us there are the top industry leaders.
We are partners of Origin Protocol since 2017, and we are working together with them on our vertical.
Our mission is to move the whole Travel Industry to Web3 as soon as possible.

Aims

With this grant we intend to start an in depth technical research and develop a first working version.

Status

As web3 adoption (too) slowly grows in the travel industry and L2/Sidechains offer a glimpse in scalability, we are getting ready to start working on the protocol.
At the end of round 10, we'll prepare the final specs and work on the release of v1.

FAQ

- ""Won't the OTA fight this legally?""
Sure, but do they really want to start this conversation?
It may end up badly for them and a judge may rule that reviews belong to the user, not to them.
If this happens the gates are open for disruption of their siloed data, not only from decentralized solutions but from a lot of centralized startups.


- ""Won't the OTA fight scraping?""
They probably will. At the moment this does not seem to be the case as there are several centralised companies doing exactly that.
When this becomes a problem we may decide to use browser plugins where the user extracts the content and provides it to the protocol.

- ""Won't the OTA deplatform Hosts who do that?""
It’s possible. They in fact deplatform for much less.
This is why each Host has to decide what is more risky: a complete dependency on OTAs or losing their reviews.

716,cointigo-universal-financial-access,"CoinTigo is a Fintech platform that provides access to financial services and a payment gateway via SMS. By using the lowest common technological denominator SMS ""short message service"" we can reach demographic sectors who do not have access to the traditional banking system, individuals subject to failed economic policies, or populations with serious limitations on their fundamentals rights and freedoms. CoinTigo does not require internet, advanced technological devices, or prior knowledge with cryptocurrencies. Using natural language commands via text messages, any user can send or receive payments, remittances, or donations in cryptocurrencies globally.

In Venezuela, there has been a dramatic decline in the number of Venezuelans with access to banking services, as well as a notable decrease in the ability of banking institutions to meet the demand for basic tools such as debit cards, points of sale systems, credit cards and fiat currency notes.

Additionally, the policies generated by the Venezuelan regulatory bodies are unclear at best. Runaway inflation of the local currency has caused a lack of economic stability necessary to maintain a solid banking system and payment networks.

As such, an exodus of refugees has generated significant destabilization in the region. These refugees often lack tools or access to services to maintain their economic activity and rely on the ""mostly informal"" market. Sending of remittances is now handled by non-regular channels which put the individual at an even greater risk. In Venezuela alone, the volume of operations for LocalBitcoins.com exceeds the volume of operations of the Caracas FOREX and even the volume at borders towns with Brazil and Colombia.

Our services in Latin America aim at providing financial freedom through Cryptocurrency FinTech and DeFi to a wide population, from a refugee merchant to a grandmother. To achieve this we have developed our service around the most liquid crypto assets in the region; Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, Horizen, Bitcoin Private and Komodo.

Our system provides users:
• Remittances and Value Transfer - Through different Blockchains and Tokens.
• Access to finance - Through Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and peer to peer (P2P) Markets. (work in progress)
• Fintech - Access to and abstraction of the technology, reducing friction and technical requirements for users. Offers individuals or organizations point of sale tools without additional software or hardware.

Short and Long term scaling solutions

Volatility and Inflation protection- Add a DeFi stable instrument to be use as US Dollar; DAI, this will allow eliminating volatility and the high cost per transaction of instruments such as Bitcoin.

Capital Growth- Add DeFi instruments to be used as an interest-earning account (savings accouts): cDAI ""~5% interest"".

Liquidity Growth- Implement the integration of our services with cryptocurrency-based ATM networks and point of sales (POS) in the region.

Venezuela headquarter stability- Change the current work model in the Venezuela development office, migrate to an incubator, remote, freelance model in Venezuela, in order to guarantee the stability and protection of the CoinTigo keymen and development team in Venezuela (80% of the entire CoinTigo team) and Move the administrative operations outside of Venezuela.

Venezuela service access- implement redundant numbers and additional communication layers; Email, WhatsApp, Twitter.

Maintain Compliance- Acquire money service business (MSB) / money transmitter license (MTL) license in the US to operate in all states, giving the ability to US NGOs or private sector use our service to reach their goal directly. Implement AML and KYC policies and procedures compatible with the US and EU standards in order to guarantee the safety of long-term operations and offer our service to NGOs that want to bring help directly to affected people. EU (Estonia) AML certification and operator license (SEPA).

Increase Adoption- Acquire the .com domain. Rebrand CoinTigo(logo, colors, website) in order to achieve better and more effective communication with the Latin American population. Promote and train the productive sector (goods and services), students, and the population in general, on how to adopt cryptocurrencies in its economic activity or lifestyle in order to achieve financial freedom and access to the global market (conferences, meetups, airdrops, handle through our partners in Latam ).

Fiat ramp- Implement an ON/OFF-Fiat ramp, considering that the most effective and secure solution is to develop a p2p-escrow market (person to person) integrated to our service via SMS focused on the countries where the migratory flow has generated the greatest impact; Peru, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Colombia & Venezuela, following the Localbitcoins.com model but leveraged on a stable instrument paired with US Dollar.



PROPOSAL:
We are proposing for the community to fund partially or completely ETH / DeFi integration & our infrastructure in LatAm. The result would be that the CoinTigo team as partners will drive adoption and the impact of DeFi in Latin America.
At the moment, there are several barriers to the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. Speed and cost of cryptocurrency transactions are some of the primary barriers. DeFi is the leading tool that allows us to provide our users with the speed and low use cost necessary to overcome these major barrier.

Our goal is to continue development in order to launch ETH, DAI, cDAI and other tokens hopefully launching the service together with Consensys at a large conferences where we can onboard thousands of new users live via our airdrop functionality. With the speed and low cost of transactions provided by Ethereum we believe that our platform can do all of the mobile commerce functions that ApplePay or GPay, WeChat pay, AliPay without any of the privacy concerns while leveraging legacy technology like SMS cell networks to reach the unbanked.

I AM GONNA MAKE A CULTIVATION BASED NFT

Why do Most NFTs seem like useless?

	NFTs of today only have perceived value. Most of them operate on speculation first before inherent value, most have no future use, and some of them even just mint the NFT and ask the world to make something for it. These kinds of projects dilute the real value of NFTs and gives it a bad image. These projects get their value from people bandwagon-ing and FOMO.
These projects honestly feel degrading and the market is over-saturated with these. I thought NFTs were meant for the metaverse, so I want to make that world.

TDLR

Path of Dao will give NFT's real value in a metaverse centered around the players with a working player-controlled decentralized economy in a Martial Arts Fantasy universe.

The Idea

	So about me. I am a huge wuxia and xianxia fan. This could only mean one thing: Cultivation. In Chinese Wuxia and Mythology, its all about self-improvement which is technically cultivation. Basing this NFT Project on cultivation comes with lots of boons. It appeals to anyone that consumes any form of wuxia, xianxia, or martial arts based stories, products, or whatever you can think of. This is also a huge appeal in China as more historical or costume dramas are gaining popularity over the years.

	Upon discovering the intricate and incredible use of contracts by ""Aavegotchi"", I was inspired. I had also played a previous game called ""Immortal Taoist""; however, that game had lacked a lot of the things and was mostly just a money grab by the devs. I had also played a game called ""Age of Wushu"" which had hundreds of Wuxia novels packed into it as content. Jin Yong's novel was one of the prominent story lines in that MMORPG that stuck to me. There were also other inspirations with more fantasy like novels that goes beyond the realm of mortals. To me, the concept of immortality and immortal realms in Chinese mythology fits the metaverse so well. After all, once a metaverse is made, it's there forever for as long as the chain lives.

	My idea is to create this NFT project that packs all of these concepts into the metaverse. From Cultivating your character, to battling divine beasts, to learning new skills that make you stronger, to uncovering the planes beyond the mortal worlds.

The Vision

	We will have a Xianxia themed semi-idle game. By semi-idle, it means that it will have active components and idle components. Idle components is passive cultivation where you accumulate cultivation to increase you character's stages and realm (sub-levels and major levels in mmo terms).

	Our game will have a low barrier of entry; which is the whole point of cultivation. In the martial arts novel, there's always the theme that the a small carp can jump over the dragon's gate, essentially meaning that anyone can become a dragon. A user will be able to join the game and start collecting cultivation immediately. As they get stronger, new activities, new systems, new worlds will open, such as the battling (PVP & PVE), resource gathering, farming, crafting, and social activities such as guilds or alliances. Lastly, all the items in this metaverse that you own in this game is fully owned by you, the player.

	We wanted to make this game to give NFTs real value in a metaverse with a working economy; all of it in a world where we spend our dreams in—a Chinese mythological setting.

Gameplay Vision

	Due to blockchain limitations, having real-time gameplay wouldn't be really possible. At the same time, we want to limit the amount of centralized (server-side) parts of the game as much as we can.

	We also didn't want to make a game that already exist in some form in centralized based games. For example, there is a blockchain MMORPG and an ARPG releasing soon. However, we believe it would take a tantamount of effort the create the necessary value proposition and fun factor to pull players away from already established games. The only difference in those blockchain games and the already established games is the asset, NFTs. Not to mention, the production quality is subpar compared to the centralized games. 

	There is also a need to mention that most blockchain games are on a ""Play-to-earn"" model. We take a hard stance against this. We will not be making a play-to-earn model game. We believe that gameplay comes first over earning. The ""earning"" should come from the value of the metaverse that you create, whether it is fun or immersive. This current model that most blockchain games push create no emotional connection with the player. The player will simply see the game as a tool to earn. We believe this image for a game is unhealthy and detrimental to the growth. Games started as a form of art in the beginning of the 90s. Why would it become something like a job? It needs to be fun, immersive, and create emotional connections. These 3 factors are what creates the value. The 'earning' portion of the game will come after the value has been established.

	Our vision is relatively simple. As the team is relatively small, we didn't want to push too much for graphical fidelity as well. We will be doing a more stylistic approach that captures the essence of Chinese mythology. One heavy inspiration we want to take from are of course, the Chinese novels, manhuas, and animations. Specifically, we want to call out is Fog Hill of the Five Elements (Wu Shan Wu Xing). If you have not seen this animation, it is definitely worth a watch. This animation is developed by a relatively small team (less than 5 animators) in China. Recently, it has gotten a lot of attention, and with that attention came investment to help the studio with the animation. The stylistic art of Fog Hill of the Five Elements is a fusion of both Traditional and Modern Chinese art. The art becomes grungy in scenes while beautifully traditional in others

	Pictures below are from Fog Hill Five Elements Episode 1:




	As for the battle system, it will be turn based combat. Players will be able to collect many different manuals, books, spells, and techniques that can give them the edge in battle. However, players will have to choose carefully which one they want to equip at certain times as players will be limited to a max of 8 different actions. That number is still set to change depending on how balance goes during development.
	
	We call our game a ""Semi-Idle MMORPG"", meaning it will be a fusion of an idle game and an MMORPG. 

	There are 3 main focus of the game:



	Cultivation is the top focus as the world is about self-improvement to attain immortality. With that, we wrap everything up with the world which contain the necessary items and ingredients to attain that immortality the player dreams of. This trio of factors will blend together to create a seamless metaverse with a working economy, conflicts, and companionships.


What is Cultivation?

In Wuxia or Xianxia (Chinese Martial Arts Fantasy), cultivation is the activity of gathering the world’s “Qi” into one’s body. By doing this, humans can become stronger and eventually become immortal. In most cultivation novels, there is a level system. Each major level is called a “Realm” and each minor level is called a “Stage”. Depending on the novel, the amount of stages vary from 3 to 9. For example: in the beginning, the main character is always at the first realm of “Qi Condensation”, and in this realm there are 3 minor stages. The second level is usually “Foundation Building”, and the third is “Qi Condensing”. For now, these are just names that are commonly used in cultivation novels.

How does it work in Path of Dao?
In Path of Dao, the levels mentioned before will also be called “Realms” and “Stages”. Our game will 20 Realms at the start and have 9 Stages because 9 is a commonly used trope in cultivation novels in reference to Houyi shooting down the 9 suns that were burning Earth. Realms and stage will be an accurate representation of a player’s general power, but it doesn’t mean everything. A player in the lower realms might be able to beat someone in a higher realm depending on how they play, strategize, or itemize.

What are paths?
In the path of cultivation, there are many ways to win whether it be through resources, intellect, brawn, or even luck. Players have the most freedom of choice on how they want to play as anything can be viable. Path of Dao is unique that we are intending for the game to have as many mysteries as possible. One such mechanic that we will have in the game is called “Paths”. As an example, there will be a choice in the beginning to be a standard cultivator or a body cultivator. A standard cultivator is accumulating Qi in order to gain strength while a body cultivator will be cultivating their own body through harsh flesh training. These two paths will have highly varying stats and stage breakthrough requirements. There will hundreds of paths that player may find or have a ‘lucky’ encounter with. Who knows what path may show if a player just solely kills slimes 8000 times in a row? At the end of the day, our game will ultimately be based on player choice. There is no wrong answer on the journey to the Dao.

How will cultivation work?
The “Semi Idle” part of thie game comes from the cultivation mechanic. Every 15 minutes, players will be able to click the “cultivate” button. This cultivate button will reward the player “Qi” based on their realm. Players will need to accumulate “Qi” in order to breakthrough to each stage. The final 9th stage will be a major breakthrough and require more “Qi” than normal to breakthrough to the next realm. Players do not need to click “cultivate” every 15 minutes to get Qi. Qi will accumulate passively based on their Realm’s Qi per second, so players will have a choice to cultivate multiple times a day, once a day, once a week, or even once a month. Again, this is all up to player’s choice. Each stage breakthrough will strengthen the player’s character to be able to traverse harsher areas in the world to find more and better treasures, elixirs, or mysteries. The higher the risk, the higher the reward.

There are more articles on our medium. Please visit us at @pathofdao to see more in-depth details of what the game will be.

1884,react-native-web3,"🤔 Question

If enabling Ethereum transactions were as simple as rendering a button, would there be any reason not to?

⚛️ About

React Native (RN) is a popular open-source frontend framework created by Facebook which helps developers rapidly deliver JavaScript applications with native performance on, well... just about anything. RN greatly improves iteration speed thanks to features such as Fast Refresh, and has been madly embraced by the open source community.

A single application written in React Native can run on Android, iOS, Web, MacOS, tvOS and the list keeps on growing. React Native is truly what it means to write once, run anywhere.

Recent advancements in faster, cheaper transaction execution, the increased popularity of social tokens and increase in consumer trust thanks to frictionless crypto onramps have placed us in a unique position to accelerate the proliferation of Ethereum in everyday applications.

To help encourage the engagement of traditional consumers, we need to race towards a world where crypto is included as standard in frontend. 

Applications should be able to communicate transaction state with one-another seamlessly, without the up-front work.

💥 The Problem

Architectural decisions made in the delivery of React Native have lead to incompatibilities with Web3.js, the industry standard for interfacing with the Ethereum blockchain (or sister chains) using JavaScript(i).

The React Native runtime is certainly not a web browser; however Web3.js absolutely expects it to be one. This leads to discrepancies between the expectations of Web3.js and what can realistically be provided at runtime (usually a crash on launch).

This means that there's a great many incredible libraries and utilities which simply cannot be utilized by a mobile application written using RN, which stifles developer adoption and limits success(ii).

🧐 The Solution

React Native developers require a sustainable, dependable ecosystem to easily write applications that can talk to the blockchain and create the next generation of cross-platform decentralized applications.

This requires:

➕ Maintenance of a base framework which ensures the security, performance and interoperability between React Native and Web3.

➕ Delivery of forks of popular libraries which help developers either exploit blockchain functionality more easily, or improve cohesion between stakeholders across the Ethereum ecosystem.

➕ Publication of higher-order libraries, components and examples which help support common use cases.

➕ Community engagement and success.

🤓 About @cawfree

I'm a React Native evangelist that has been contributing to the open source ecosystem for the past three years. I started out as a Java developer since I was a kid. I'm a member of Gitcoin's KERNEL Genesis Block, have helped bootstrap five start-ups and I'm a regular conference speaker. I was the first person to publicly break the Chirp protocol.

You can listen to me on the React Round Up podcast.

🙈 Annotations

i) You can always use Ethers, a tremendous pure JavaScript library guaranteed to successfully interact with the blockchain outside of the DOM. However, most commonly-used libraries in the Ethereum ecosystem do not assert a dependency on Ethers.

ii) Many applications have already independently leveraged the necessary hacks to enable web3js, however this poses a significant entry barrier to any developers wishing to simply prototype an idea, and severely limits the interoperability between Ethereum applications. There is no way in which we can sustain an open source ecosystem where developers can share React Native libraries without the guarantee of an expected runtime configuration.

4253,new-york-blockchain-coalition,"Summary
Regulation starts at the state level. We need to advocate now in the states that have growing anti-blockchain legislation to prevent it from influencing policy at the federal level. We have to start this lobbying process at the financial heart of the USA: New York State.

About
There is a saying in policy making: “what happens in New York and California eventually becomes the policy of the country.” It is not untrue; whether it is education, legalization, or even fashion regulation, the trends set in the largest media markets in the country have ripple effects across the entire nation, turning local experiments and sentiments about industries into established narratives.

The narrative of the blockchain/crypto industry is not yet set but it is already starting to form in these markets. Powerful forces from a variety of industries are all beginning to have opinions on the blockchain/crypto industry as they begin to understand their relationship to it, and how its success (or failure) will help or hurt them and their priorities.

For this vital sector to survive, and not go the way of other disruptive, transformational industries, we need to start working at the local and state level, as well as the federal level to steer the direction of legislation and educate current and future legislators on the potential of the blockchain/crypto space.

Why Now?
Other states and municipalities are also taking steps to create a more friendly environment for innovators in the blockchain space, leaving New York City and New York State potentially at a loss for future industry developments. This is a very real fear among legislators who care about the future of the state's innovation sector, but in the absence of a pro-blockchain voice, they will be influenced by the information coming from other sources they are familiar with, such as the green energy sector or anti-blockchain activists.

Having had previous success, educating and creating policies for elected officials around the blockchain industry, we propose creating the New York Blockchain Coalition (NYBCC) to create a dedicated organization whose sole purpose is educating legislators on the benefits of the blockchain, monitoring and responding to new legislation proposed, and serving as a point of contact for the blockchain professionals and enthusiasts in New York State. 

It is unlikely that New York State will adopt similar laissez-faire policies as Wyoming, so we must take a proactive approach in shaping the industry so that an approach, guided by the people closest to the technology and invested in its widespread adoption, becomes the model nationwide. We are not starting from scratch: there are pro-blockchain forces at the state and city level. We need to create more allies, expand more people’s thinking, and fight back against the forces who want to paint a gross caricature of the industry as a useless, environment-destroying ponzi scheme (because they will fill the void this way if we do not create a narrative ourselves).

The Goal:
We hope to incorporate and fund a 501c4 organization dedicated solely to the public good of educating legislators on the benefits of the blockchain, monitoring and responding to new legislation proposed, and serving as a point of contact for the blockchain professionals and enthusiasts in New York State. We have registered lobbyists at the federal, city, and state levels who are ready and excited to get to work on the project and have experience in the industry as well as lobbying for New York State.

How We Get There:
If funded, we would build our coalition of companies, supportive organizations, et. al., and source directly from them the priorities for each legislative session and the appropriate actions to achieve these goals, reporting regularly on the progress and ‘insider baseball’ so that we might leverage the collective knowledge and resources of our community for its furtherance. This would translate into direct action events, social media and PR campaigns targeted at creating influence at crucial times, and even assisting in drafting policy white papers.

Why HZQ?
HZQ specializes in engaging and highly targeted marketing campaigns around political races, advocacy around causes, and supporting non-profit’s in support of their missions. We have been successfully working with these for about 5 years and have learned a thing or two about effectively driving behavior change.

As stewards of this project, we will update the community on hzqconsulting.com/NYBCC with the exact ads and their targets as well as raw results for anyone to see.

We were the first to create batch mintable NFTs for everyone to use, the first tool to manage NFTs (before they were cool) and now we are pushing the space forward even more. 

We spent a year building our v2.0 which launched 4 days ago - it includes many features that are pivotal to the NFT ecosystem .

We redesigned ERC-721 contracts to optimize gas costs and allow for batch minting 2,000 NFTs in a single transaction (the highest anywhere)
We created EIP-2981 a royalty standard to allow all marketplaces to accept royalties from other marketplaces 
We created the very first DAO contract that runs completely off NFTs 

All of these are open source and available for anyone to use, you can find them on Etherscan.

We rejected ICO offers, we will never have an ERC-20, we are not VC funded. 

But we have over 5,000 users, created over 1,250 smart contracts for users, created over 10k NFTs for users. 

We would appreciate any support you would love to provide us - so we can continue building a next generation platform for creators and NFT users.

2221,kawaii-batttle-royale-no-loss-esports-tournament-,"
Kawaii Battle Royale (KBR): Switch Bullet is a NO-LOSS team-based multiplayer first-person shooter, similar to games like Overwatch.

Except that, rather than player paying to download the game we implement a ""Stake to Play"" model. As well as allow players to enter NO-LOSS Weekly Tournaments.

Each tournament has a base entry fee set in a stable currency such as USDC or BUSD. To enter a tournament the player must stake the entry fee, which gets locked for the duration of the tournament. In return the game, issues a Tournament Entry NFT and a set of ERC-20 KAWAII governance tokens.

The Tournament Entry NFT must be later burned to redeem the staked entry once the tournament ends - hence the notion of NO-LOSS.

For each tournament, the staked entries are pooled and deposited in a money-market liquidity pool such as AAVE.

The game is currently tested in Kovan and in Harmony testnet. To accomplish the latter in Harmony, we leverage the Harmony Bridge to allow our Game Oracle to transfer the staked entries (Harmony BUSD) to Ethereum BUSD and deposit it to AAVE. 

The Game Oracle then monitors the state of the tournament / bracket, issues randomization, and sets the winner of the tournament in the core Game Contract.

We have also developed a set of NFT Character Starter Pack, which can be borrowed or purchased.

50 events is the total # of events we delivered in 2019... 
... and without realizing it, we have delivered more events in these 3 months than in 2019.
Delivering meaningful virtual events as effectively as physical events was the #1 concern.
Thankfully, we managed to successfully overcome that as well. The feedback we have received for our events has been very positive.
So, thank you again for supporting us in the last round.


Gitcoin Round VI

We did not manage to launch the BitcoinMalaysia DAO in the last 3 months.
We still want to make it happen. However, we realize it is not as easy as it sounds. 
Good news is, we have identified a growing # of active contributors in the community, which is a more important metric, in our opinion. 
The current founding members of the BitcoinMalaysia community group feel it is more realistic to launch a DAO after Gitcoin Round VII.
A lot of DAOs fail because they launch the DAO first and ask the hard questions later.
We will be asking ourselves a lot of hard questions in the next 3 months.
Meanwhile, for Gitcoin Round VI, the grant funds we receive will be used for: 
Scaling our operations of what already works.
Documenting our process of onboarding beginners that works on Gitbook.
Continue running weekly webinars for cryptocurrency beginners consistently. 
Identify and appoint at least two active contributors in the community. 
Onboard them to run weekly webinars for cryptocurrency beginners.
Each ideally accessing a different demographic group e.g. Malay language, Mandarin language. 
Research and decide a DAO launch strategy by the next Gitcoin Round VII.


Who is BitcoinMalaysia

BitcoinMalaysia is the largest cryptocommunity in the Southeast Asia. Founded since 2012, we started from a simple blog website and after many meetups, our group has organically grown to 56,000 people; 22,000 active monthly.

Our Mission

Cryptocurrencies are difficult to learn for new people, and is scary because the industry is filled with bad actors. That is why, the role BitcoinMalaysia plays is to
Provide a safe, neutral, and friendly space for new people to learn about cryptocurrencies
Help new entrants quickly identify scams and the fake so that they can focus on the real ones.
Inspire more Malaysians to BUIDL, participate in DAOs and the Ethereum ecosystem.
Help blockchain projects find their early adopters, fans and eventually champions.


Our Promise

Our specialty lies in onboarding new people outside of crypto and helping funnel the now properly equipped individual to participate in DAOs, take up bounties and jobs in crypto industry confidently. Our methodologies will be documented to become a public good on our Github.

We constantly will improve our education material and share it openly on our Gitbook. The DAO would allow us to scale our activities. Success looks like when a person living 5 hours drive away from the city can interact with the DAO, access and iterate from the education material we have to conduct proper education in his small town.

That's where we want to be.

Please support us. Thank you.

2069,mintfund-helping-creators-mint-their-first-nfts,"To mint is to add to humanity’s history. We mint together.

This is the Mint Fund.

Mint Fund is a community project created with the sole purpose to build a support network for artists interested in bringing their art into the world of crypto as NFTs.

We provide artists with the funds (known as gas costs) needed to mint NFTs. The team also offers guidance, mentorship, and advice for our growing community of artists.

The fund is accessible to all artists, though we prioritize BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ artists, especially outside of North America and the European Union. 

In February 2021, we announced the first round of creators to participate in the Mint Fund. Applications will continue to be accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis. To apply, fill out this form.   


———————————————————

FAQ

What does it mean to “mint”?
When you mint an NFT, you create a record of your work that will live for as long as the internet itself. Your words, songs, memories, photos, videos, code, 3D objects, memes—whatever shape your artistic vision manifests in—enter the public sphere in a way that was not possible before: immutable, irremovable, transparent and permanent.

To mint requires having access, infrastructure, and the resources to do so. For us, it is critical to make the ability to mint available to as many artists as possible, regardless of background.

Where can we mint?
While you can mint on any platform, we are in favor of marketplaces that allow you to truly own your NFTs and sign your contracts using your wallet.

Will there be any kind of accountability/analysis/record of how funds are being used–who they are going to, in what quantities, to mint what works, etc.
Yes. All of our records and statistics will be released quarterly outside of the milestones we will champion on social media.

What is the Mint Fund’s mission?
We aim to foster a diverse community of creatives by offering resources—gas costs, the Mint Fund Discord, workshops, artist AMAs, partnership opportunities, and more—to empower multiple generations of artists mint and own their work. 

How many NFTs can I mint if I am accepted? 
The Mint Fund only pays for your first NFT mint. It is imperative that every artist who is accepted to participate in the Mint Fund gets a fair shake.

3356,daorayaki,"To Empower People, We Must Decentralize Information.

First of all, we would like to thank Gitcoin contributors for believing and granting DAOrayaki in Gitcoin GR11, “thank you for putting faith in us!”. DAOrayaki received a total of $47,667 in Gitcoin's 11th grant round and it is still going! where DAOrayaki is considered one of the top granted projects when it comes to community support and matching funds in the Decentralized Governance (dGov) track.

After nearly ten months of practice, we are pleased to announce that DAOrayaki will enter the dGov 2.0 era, i.e., the transition from semi-decentralized governance led by decentralized funding and executive committees to decentralized editorial committees and community-committees co-governance.

What is DAOrayaki and how to achieve DAOrayaki dGov2.0？

DAOrayaki is a fully functional decentralized research media that represents the community's will and is controlled by the community. It is initiated by the core community members of DAOONE, which is China's first DAO organization. It receives support from the DAO's infrastructure provider “Dora Factory”. 

Decentralized media (dMedia) is a new exploration. There is no clear and reproducible path to how to achieve it. However, one thing is sure: effective dMedia should empower the community while preserving the efficiency and competitiveness of central media(cMedia). Therefore, DAOrayaki defines a fully functional decentralized media, which should include three aspects core functions, extended functions, and edge functions:

The core function of dMedia emphasizes decentralization, which is the only way to empower the community and it cannot be compromised. The edge function of dMedia emphasizes efficiency, which is the advantage of cMedia, and the middle function is the expandable boundaries of dMedia.

Since its establishment in February 2021, DAOrayaki has been gradually practicing the functions of dMedia around the above three aspects. At present, part of the core governance function of dMedia has been initially realized, that is, decentralized funding. Now we will meet new challenges and expand the boundaries of dMedia, i.e., to realize the full decentralization of the editorial board.

Phase 1: Decentralized funding

Through the form of DAO, DAOrayaki decentrally funds researchers from all over the world to conduct research, translation, and innovative analytics. Therefore, DAOrayaki realized community funding and media management, where the scope of funding includes three types: mechanism research, project reports, and DAO tools. As the figure 👇🏼👇🏼  briefly shows:


Each week, the core team (committee) of the DAO handpicks a list of state-of-the-art topics and distributes the corresponding tasks to the contributors community. After the tasks are completed, the articles are submitted to a review group for pre-publication voting. The review group initially consists of 7 DAO fans who are highly involved in DAOs and blockchain infrastructure project governance. The review group then votes for the articles based on a Moloch-like rule. Articles that receive a pass from the review group will be published on the DAOrayaki website (daorayki.org). At the same time, contributors will receive community grants. DAOrayaki uses a multi-signature wallet to coordinate funders and research content contributors (DAOrayaki.eth).

Over the past nine months, DAOrayaki has formed a contributor network composed of PhDs, crypto enthusiasts, DAO OGs, and even high school students. DAOrayaki's contributor network has deeply covered dozens of topics, including Quadratic Funding, Futarchy, dGov, Moloch, algorithmic governance, Retroactive Public Goods Funding, and Ostrom public affairs governance methods, also Ethereum ecological research results. The DAOrayaki contributors community contributed 190 articles, covered 71 projects, published 114 original research articles, it was well received by its community and beyond and it is still going up!. 

In the first phase of DAOrayaki's development, DAOrayaki received the largest matching funding from Dora Factory Community QF Round-1. More than 3500 users contributed to the DAOrayaki grant. After that, it received a total of $47,667 during the Gitcoin GR-11. Thanks to the community's faith! DAOrayaki is considered as one of the top projects, when it comes to Gitcoin Decentralized Governance (dGov) track.

Phase 2: Decentralized editorial board

As more and more readers and contributors join the community, it is necessary to further improve the design and implementation of the DAOrayaki governance mechanism to realize credible media with the highest confidence that represents the community's will. We belief that the economics circulation 👇🏼👇🏼 serves the ""infonauts community""


To achieve this mission, the second phase of DAOrayaki will focus on the decentralization of the editorial board. The decentralization of the editorial board includes essential matters such as topic planning, content review, and hot trends prediction. The realization of this process requires the full participation of the community through appropriate governance mechanisms. After in-depth and extensive discussions in the community, DAOrayaki will achieve content governance and hot trends prediction by introducing the Futarchy governance mechanism.

Content governance: This is the core step of the decentralization of the editorial board, that is, it is handed over to the community for topic planning, screening, and review. Community contributors can independently plan research topics and apply for corresponding grants. This process is divided into four stages:

As you can see down below, the diagram explains the multiple stages of the ""content governance""



Hot trends prediction: All community members can use the futarchy mechanism to bet on Top N articles in a seven days period (from the opening of the prediction market to the end) and receive rewards. Below our beloved contributors can have a brief understanding on how hot trends prediction works!



The realization of decentralized funding is the smallest feasible form of dMedia. DAOrayaki's mission is to establish a credible media with the highest credibility that represents the community's will. The decentralized editorial board is another innovative attempt to achieve DAOrayaki's mission. In this governance stage, the power of topic planning and partial review is delegated to the community, and professionals control the final review and publication. It not only exerts the community's creativity but also guarantees the quality and efficiency of the media. The decentralized editorial board will bring new vitality to DAOrayaki, and at the same time, provide new guidelines and ideas for the construction and design of dMedia.

Latest updates

Innovate. Inform. Inspire //All you need is a decentralized push!

First of all, as usual we can't go through this without the faith of Gitcoin contributors for believing and granting DAOrayaki in Gitcoin GR12 once again!, “thank you for putting faith in us!”. DAOrayaki received a total of $17,126 in Gitcoin's 12th grant round! Where DAOrayaki as always considered one of the top granted projects when it comes to community support and matching funds in the Decentralized Governance (dGov) track.

After nearly four months of practice, we are here to announce the latest updates within DAOrayaki journey! After entering the dGov 2.0 era, i.e., the transition from semi-decentralized governance led by decentralized funding and executive committees to decentralized editorial committees and community-committees co-governance. DAOrayaki officially launched the required crafts for the decentralized governance under three parts: Prediction markets platform, Articles platform, and Community discussions forum. We believe these crafts are the right choice for the community to go through the decentralized media journey! In addition, DAOrayaki fully implemented and enhance the discord server to be used side-by-side with the discussions forum for an efficient content workspace. 

Now we took the brief salutation off the way let's get to the detailed progress!

Phase 3: DAOrayaki governance
As the main source of social information, the media bears certain social responsibilities. Therefore, in the process of implementing democratic governance, there are higher requirements to value-voting and value-oriented high-quality communities. As a result, DAOrayaki designed and fully implemented the below governance scale as a way of escorting to its beloved community. The governance scale consists of 7 different cells as follows: Become a content creator: ""Infonauts"", Become a governaut: ""Community governauts"", ""Operation governauts"", ""Editorial board governauts"", ""Technology governauts"", ""Treasury governauts"", and lastly Become a chairperson: ""GURUs"". side-by-side they represents the DAOrayaki decentralized media community.

The above governance scale were designed based on a divide and conquer strategy (//His military strategy is to divide and conquer) and a game theory (//If we are not our brother's keeper, at least let us not be his executioner) approach and that is to guarantee the following essential points:

For the divide and conquer strategy: 
Efficient governance; 
Fairness recruitment for community members; 
Flexible communication and tasks management. 

For the game theory approach: 
Community incentivization; 
Governance transparency; 
Interactivity and dynamicity.

The governance scale clears the way for the community members ""DAOrayakers"" on how to put their goals within the community, and collaborate on tasks in a flexible way that guarantees fairness and efficiency. Based on their expertises, skills and vows to the community, they will be assigned to the designated governance cell they want to be within. For such a reason, DAOrayaki decentralized governance were enhanced and well re-organized. As we said at the start, ""All you need is a decentralized push!""

The following figure represents the details about the governance scale were you can see the various duties and rights within DAOrayaki: 


Joining one of 7 cells requires a set of ""Digits requirements"" and ""Skills + Activities requirements"" (You can refer to DAOrayaki discord server for more information on this) eventually, after setting up a goal for a certain cell within the governance scale DAOrayakers gathers the needed requirements and they are good to go as a part of DAOrayaki content creation, governance, or even the high-committee members. As we mentioned before, we believe this way guarantees the interactivity and incentivization of the community in addition to a transparent governance model.

Now to accomplish the prediction markets and governance, we need an asset for the utility and circulation. For such a reason, DAOrayaki deployed a non-monetary governance token for its community denoted under the ticker ""YAKID"" (DAOrayaki + IDentity)and a virtual asset within the community server base (Discord) denoted as ""DYakID"" (Discord YakID).

Why non-monetary governance tokens?
Governance tokens with non-monetary attributes has no endogenous value, but has governance authority. Such tokens have the following characteristics: 
Earned through community contributions; 
Represents certain governance authority; 
Non-tradable and non transferable.
Governance tokens with non-monetary attributes avoid the problems associated with buy-votes to a certain extent. Combined with Futarchy mechanism, it not only guarantees the voting value, but also realizes high-quality participating community. DAOrayaki follows the above strategy with the non-monetary token ""YAKID."" For the discord virtual asset ""DYakID"" it is mainly involved in cells recruitment digits requirements, community giveaways, contests and much more!

Let's get back to the content space a bit. 

Encouragement is a must: Bounties (//Bounties were paid to colonial producers of indigo dye)
Alongside the prediction markets, DAOrayaki holds Bounties program now as a way of encouragement to the community members, from time to time DAOrayaki editorial board sets a list of bounties that requires to be solved by community members. These bounties include Articles creation, Projects analysis, or Videos/Podcasts explanations. It follows a FIFS standard ""First In First Served"" with the potentiality of re-claiming by others if a certain bounty was not fulfilled!


Roadmap: DAOrayaki journey
Through the past months, the team behind DAOrayaki was working as its best to provide the best product possible and expected to achieve DAOrayaki mission! We are constantly implementing, optimizing, and innovating through the journey, as they say ""sum small efforts leads to accomplishments."" For this reason, we are following the below roadmap, and we are sure with absolute certainty and faith that we are on the right path. So, thanks again to our gitcoin contributors for putting faith on us and making this vision possible to make! We meet next time with other completed quests!

Community AMAs Calls; 
DAOrayaki Podcasts Program. 

This was resulted due to the fact of the obvious increasing of DAOrayaki content discussion. It has been approved from DAOrayaki GURUs that encouraging community members through the above strategies lead to a better understanding of decentralized medias and the way they work. In this process, the community network saw a major growth across the time.

In addition, we are bringing a new ""Polyglot Scholars"" out soon enough to our community members stay connected with us! The profile will be updated soon enough!!

2833,using-commitment-voting-for-better-dao-governance,"Commitment voting is a new mechanism for signalling intensity of preferences in blockchain voting systems, developed by cryptoeconomics researchers at RMIT University’s Blockchain Innovation Hub. 

We believe commitment voting can be a powerful tool for GitcoinDAO to encourage governors to stake their GTC tokens and make informed governance decisions for the long term security of the network. However, it is a general mechanism that can be adopted by any DAO or governance community.

We are seeking funding support to formalise, develop and test commitment voting so that it can be used for DAOs across the ecosystem, including GitcoinDAO. 

The basic idea:

Commitment voting is a time-weighted voting mechanism with some highly desirable properties. Commitment voting brings more and better information into governance decisions. One of the advantages of commitment voting is that it encourages long-term commitment to participation in governance.

We spell out the basics of the mechanism in: Berg, C., Davidson, S., & Potts, J. (2020) “Commitment Voting: A Mechanism for Intensity of Preference Revelation and Long-Term Commitment in Blockchain Governance"".

In commitment voting, the ‘weight’ of a vote is determined both by how many tokens a voter is willing to stake, and by how long the voter is willing to stake the tokens for. The more committed they are to an individual governance vote, the longer they choose to stake.

The cost of staking is dependent on the opportunity cost of time, so voters with higher benefits can bear the cost of staking longer. 

Voters who vote on the losing side of a vote are released from their committed staking period.

With this funding we will: 

a) Formally model commitment voting, including developing an optimal vote weight decay function to prevent opportunistic staking, allowing it to be specified and deployed
b) Simulate behaviour under commitment voting on cadCAD so that DAOs can deploy the model in confidence that it has been battle tested.
 
Ultimately we would like to present commitment voting to for potential implementation by GitcoinDAO and others in the Ethereum ecosystem.

3475,nectar-hipaa-compliant-decentralized-storage-and-,"Nectar is a privacy-preserving, publicly accessible, highly scalable L2 purpose built for devs who want to impact healthcare globally using web3 tech.

Protocol - High Level
Rarely in web3 does it make sense to reinvent the basics, so we’re building on and altering proven, robust infrastructure to make it “healthcare safe” 

We’re building on top of and altering Ceramic+IPFS to create the HIPAA compliant decentralized storage and zkSync+zkPorter (when released) to create the zk rollup infra.

This makes Nectar a privacy-preserving and highly scalable protocol.

Why Nectar?
Healthcare is actually quite broken - globally.
It is highly inefficient
There’s little focus on “customer experience” (ie: actually enjoying your Dr’s visits; getting timely care without having to pay to “jump to the front of the line” in places with gov’t insurance)
It is wicked expensive - global healthcare costs are rising faster than the global economy
In many places - not just the United States - monopolies and enterprise dominate the landscape in the exact same way they do in other areas of our lives (note: we include inefficient government healthcare infra in the “monopoly and enterprise” bucket)

The same reasons we’re drawn to web3 for other industries are the same for healthcare: the opportunity to redesign healthcare, and realign incentives that focus on those truly at the center: YOU (the patient) and your clinician/physician.

BUT this new future can’t happen without a private protocol that secures highly sensitive data such as your health data.

Changes to existing infra
We analyzed (via deep-diving in the code) >60 existing infras for privacy, decentralized storage, and rollups and found that Ceramic, IPFS, and zkSync will provide the best baseline for our engineering.  Some of the changes we’re making to this base infra include:
Privacy preserving smart contracts, including:
Smart contract permissions
Smart contract invocation
L2 improvements, including:
Extensible rollup blocks
HIPAA compliant decentralized data storage services
Network improvements, including:

This lack of visibility limits trust in the market and in the players who populate it. A market without trust will not be able to expand to its maximum potential and will always be full of bad actors who can carry out illegal actions.

The blockchain was created to bring trust where it is lacking. Therefore NFTs could be a positive tool if used correctly.

The other important aspect to consider is the decentralization of the files connected to the NFTs.

Today, most of the files related to NFTs are stored offchain. This severely limits trust.
However, it is possible to choose solutions that, although not perfect, allow you to keep files in decentralized storage, such as using IPFS.

To date, a first analysis of the best-known smart contracts has identified that 69% of NFTs are centralized.
Centralized storage, such as on AWS or other storage service providers, while more efficient solutions do not give the market the confidence that it should be: what happens if a server is not paid for? Or if it gets hacked? All NFTs present would be compromised, thus leading to considerable damage to the owners, as well as to the entire world of crypto art.

How Nifty Crawler works?

Selecting a Smart Contract you get the list of all the NFTs present.

For each NFT the following are displayed:
- The Smart Contract address, with the link to Etherscan
- The Token ID
- The Token URI, which allows you to read the NFT metadata
- The type of Media, which allows you to download the media via the browser
- The state of decentralization of the NFT
- The state of decentralization of the Media


Nifty Crawler next steps
Here is a list of some of the features we are planning to introduce, step by step:

Automatic scan of all ERC721 / ERC1155 smart contracts and of their NFTs
Add more blockchains, starting with Polygon, BSC and other EVM compatible blockchains and then proceed with Wax, Flare and others

Women make up 10% - 30% of those working in blockchain

We're seeing a generational transference of wealth and it's vital women don't miss out.

If we're to truly build radical solutions to global problems that blockchain technology can enable, then we need everyone at the design, development and deployment table, and that includes women.
Let's see blockchain companies built with gender inclusion from the start, this means having a minimum of 30% women in senior roles.
We have a shortfall of engineers and CTO's in Web 3.0. Let's upskill those in senior positions to move into the blockchain space. Then make sure we retain them.

0 – CTO Program
 
Upskill female engineers and CTOs from other tech sectors in blockchain and Web 3.0. Provide them with the ecosystem, network and support to thrive.
 
Step 1: Map the ecosystem, learn what already exists in terms of education/training, identify what's missing and provide support and fill the gaps (build the ladders) for female engineers and CTO in Web 3.0 world. Start with a few key partners and build-out.
Step 2: Connecting the ecosystem to create full stack engineers and technical leaders. To both develop the startup ecosystem and link in enterprise. Working with key partners across all disciplines.
Step 3: Our programme will initially target senior engineers to CTO level. We need to bring in decision-makers now to make sure we can grow blockchain based businesses with Diversity from the start.
Then...
Provide training and structured guidance including; leadership skills, media training, negotiation, managing difficult conversations, networking, mentorship and sponsorship to back up the women in every area to ensure their success.
Understand the skills and roles that are being sought by the sector and matching those in the program with these opportunities.
Raise the profile of these talented women to correct social norms, while solving the talent shortfall of engineers and CTOs in the space.
Provide companies with easy-to-implement design processes to ensure they attract and retain diverse talent that matches their needs.

4024,refi-dao-a-diverse-founder-led-impact-community,"ReFi DAO: A Founder-Led Impact Community

ReFi DAO is a founder-led startup community that accelerates impact for people and planet. We're working to embed Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion into the heart of the ReFi movement...

Thanks to a successful GR13 grant round from generous donors, we secured over $22k in funding. With it, we accomplished a number of objectives while retaining $9,863 in reserves. We have detailed each initiative and their updates in our: GR13 Grant Round Update.

Core thesis

We believe the greatest point of leverage to accelerate impact is found in the quality of relationships and the depth of interactions between founders in the ReFi movement.
If we can create deeply aligned clusters of ReFi founders in local and global communities, we will witness a new era of human and planetary flourishing known as the “Regenerative Renaissance”.
We can do this by nurturing regenerative culture through education and events and building coordination tools for identity, incentives and accountability.

What is next?

For the next twelve months, we’re focusing on two core areas to fulfill our mission and vision.
Culture Build
Protocol Build

1. Culture Build

We are building a new culture at the unlikely intersection of climate action and web3 with an intention to propel humanity into a regenerative economy and beyond. In order to regenerate the earth, we must work to heal ourselves and our communities. 

There are a variety of community-led initiatives that have emerged within ReFi DAO that help co-create and cultivate a regenerative culture in web3 with Justice Equity Diversity and Inclusion at the heart:

ReFi Podcast*
ReFi Circles
ReFiDAO.com
ReFi Fellowship (8 week course with open source curriculum)
ReFi Contributor Program
Kernel Regeneration Guild
ReFi Roundup
ReFi Garden Workshops (1-2 hrs)
ReFi Jobs & Talent Collective

For more information on any of these activities, click on the links above.

Culture Build Budget: 50% of grant proceeds
As building culture requires people and time, we are committed to engage people from traditionally excluded communities
Funding will enable us to setup a paid DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) council to help early stage founders grow organizations with these values at heart, and also to hold ReFi DAO accountable for these objectives
We are focused on spanning timezones to allow the global majority to participate
We actively recruit founders from diverse backgrounds and pursue traditionally marginalized communities through partnerships
Depending on the actual grant funding allocated, we will disperse funds appropriately

*ReFi Podcast has received grant funding from Climate Collective and will not receive any funding from Gitcoin GR14.

2. Protocol Build

We are building a new protocol that allows ReFi founders to:
Experience ReFi culture
Earn trust
Coordinate action for real-world impact

This vision for a protocol emerged at a ReFi Spring event in Portugal in April between friends from Toucan, Flowcarbon, Regen Network, Eden DAO, New Atlantis, Impacta and IDEO.

There are three key components of the protocol we are building:
ReFi Passport
Impact Gauges
Impact Explorer

1. ReFi Passport — culture & trust

A ReFi Passport is allows anyone to join ReFi DAO by minting a ReFi orb while making a commitment to accelerate impact through a voluntary membership fee which can be a:
Voluntary tax (on income, or gains)
Recurring membership (monthly or annual)

This voluntary membership is one of the core ways that members can earn REFI tokens.

Tokens are issued as a function of the impact of a member’s on-chain wallet activity as attributed by an impact score. The impact score is multiplied as a function of the membership fees, capital lock-up and other factors.
We are also creating scholarships and programs to allow members to receive and earn REFI tokens to encourage participation from low-income communities.

The issuance of ReFi tokens is a proposal-driven policy mechanism, as are the drivers of the impact score.

Culture & plasticity

Inspired by the work of Ene SS Rawa in our community, we are exploring how ReFi Passports can cross-pollinate connections between members based on their levels of commitment, experience and aspirations in the space so that:
New founders can meet other new founders
Experienced founders can hang out with their peers
New founders can find mentors through willing experienced founders

2. Impact Gauges

Defining impact objectively is an impossible task. Outside of measuring a ton of carbon, it’s difficult to evaluate the ecological and social benefit of various activities.
We’re designing a protocol that allows for our community to reach consensus about what impact looks like to this community over a specific period of time. In doing so, this unlocks a new level of coordination to address the challenges of:
Climate change
Ecosystem collapse
Social injustice

We’re working on a couple primitives that combine conviction voting with curve-style gauges to create an impact score for on-chain activities so we can enable ReFi DAO members to coordinate with other members towards campaigns that incentivize the market to perform behaviors such as:
Providing liquidity for GNT, NBO or NCT (nature-based carbon credits)
Burning BCT (Base Carbon Tonne)
Encouraging UBI donations (Universal Basic Income)
Buying ecosystem credits (Water, Biodiversity, etc.)
Participating in governance

3. Impact Explorer

In order to ensure the REFI token and impact gauges are incentivizing real-world impact, we are building an Impact Explorer which bridges the gap between the on-chain and off-chain world.
You can imagine a visual network explorer with two layers:
On-chain activities
Off-chain activities

This component would allow researchers, policy advisors, impact investors and DAO members to inspect the relationship between on-chain and off-chain events. Given both of these are complex systems, this is about doubling down on the power of transparency and accountability provided by public blockchains.

The off-chain activities layer could be powered by data marketplaces from the Open MRV Protocol from MRV Collective, dClimate and Regen Network. We’re still in the research and development phase, and would welcome conversations with interested partners.

Protocol Build Budget: 50% of grant proceeds
We’re actively exploring partnerships to build out each of these primitives
We are speaking to climate-conscious VCs about raising within the next 12 months
Depending on the actual grant funding allocated, we will build accordingly

Support regeneration, inclusion and diversity in web3
We'd be so grateful for your support in GR14 as we look to support diverse founders to accelerate impact for people and the planet.

4007,carbonland-trust-perpetual-forest-conservation-pr,"https://www.carbonlandtrust.com/ Carbonland Trust creates new Old Growth Forest for future generations to enjoy. Our vision at Carbonland Trust is to scale the voluntary carbon markets by making them more inclusive, impactful, and transparent for all stakeholders.

Carbonland Trust’s decentralized conservation protocol will scale the voluntary carbon markets by improving the supply of high quality carbon removal credits. Carbonland Trust will be Platform as a Service (PaaS) for tokenizing the rights to future carbon removal credits from forest lands conserved by Carbonland Trust's protocol. 

Using our PaaS landowners can enroll forest land into our conservation protocol and then are able to offer rights to CO2 Removal Credits as digital assets. Our ESG Digital Assets yield Carbon Removal Credits ($CRC) to holders the digital assets using smart contracts. 

Our platform will allow private landowners to generate new revenue streams from protecting forests and proving landowners with more economic benefit to protect trees than they would get from cutting them down. 

Our carbon capturing digital assets help carbon credit buyers source the highest quality carbon removal credits from project protecting forests perpetually. Many carbon credits in the market come from projects that don't actually remove CO2 from the atmosphere, and some from forest that are being cut down just years after carbon credits were issued from them. 



Carbonland Trust's carbon credits are actually removing CO2 from the air and producing oxygen as a by product, and are produced from forests that are being protected from logging and fires perpetually!

Currently there is a massive carbon REMOVAL credit supply / demand imbalance.

There is Exponential Demand for and Limited supply of high quality carbon Removal credits due to all the companies pledging to become carbon neutral. Actually there are not enough Carbon Removal Credits available today on the market to satisfy just the demand of Microsoft. 

Microsoft, which has committed to remove their future and past carbon footprint have stated they will only buy carbon Removal credits now, no carbon reduction credits. Microsoft and Shopify have both created investment funds to support startups that produce carbon removal credits because they realize there are not enough high quality removal credits for them to buy.  

Globally the demand continues to grow higher and higher and possibly in the near future companies may be legally required to invest in carbon capture solutions like we have developed. The planet needs to reduce emissions and achieve net zero emissions sooner than experts predict. Carbon Removal Credits are the only way to reach zero carbon commitments. 

The Voluntary Carbon Market is GROWING FAST, and going to be HUGE!



Our carbon capture digital assets and forest conservation protocol address a soon to be trillion dollar annual market. And our PaaS offers more ROI for carbon credit buyers and the whole world than the current carbon credits on the market. 

The total addressable market we believe is 300-400B USD next year. We have seen predictions of 1-2T in the not to far future, and even 50-100T. The market is currently around 200 billion.  

Carbonland Trust is designed to stimulate growth in the voluntary carbon market. Stimulating impactful growth in the voluntary carbon market is very important for Carbonland Trust’s global mission. We believe our platform is the effective solution to sequester CO2 long term.  

By connecting companies with high quality carbon removal credit suppliers we are filling the demand for high quality carbon removal and cleaning atmosphere. And helping landowners to earn from regenerative CO2 sequestration land stewardship.





https://carbonlanddao.com/ Carbonland DAO works with Carbonland Trust
Carbonland DAO is a distributed effort to conserve and protect as many acres of bio-diverse forest land as possible, as quickly as we can.

What we do with our Governance token (CLD)
Sales of CLD is used to purchase forest land for Carbonland DAO treasury. Forest lands owned and held by Carbonland DAO are enrolled into perpetual conservation easements and managed to create bio-diverse old growth forests with lots of plant life for maximum CO2 sequestration. 

Proceeds from the sale of CLD
90% goes to purchase forested land that is owned and held by Carbonland DAO. The DAO maintains those properties to produce carbon removal credits, and provide outdoor recreational space.
10% goes to legal fees and operations costs of business to run and manage the DAO.

Forests owned by Carbonland DAO are managed to create outdoor educational and recreational opportunities for CLD holders. Our goal is to inspire generations of people to love, care for, and protect trees and nature.

Forest lands owned by Carbonland DAO are managed to produce carbon removal credits (CRC) that are sold on the voluntary carbon markets. Sales of carbon credits produced from our conserved forests are used to improve and increase the land holdings of Carbonland DAO.

Proceeds from sale of CRC produced from land held by Carbonland DAO
30% goes to purchase new forestland to add to DAO holdings. This creates sustainable revenue and increases land holding without having to raise money from the community.
30% goes to improvements to current DAO land holdings. Improvements are things that make CLD token holders visit more enjoyable.
30% goes to pay for travel and lodging expenses to create recreational lotteries. CLD stakers have chances to win unique once in a lifetime outdoor adventures.
10% goes to legal fees and operations costs of business to run and manage the DAO.

This means that once proceeds from the sales of CLD are used to purchase forest land, those forests generate sustainable revenue to protect and improve those properties, and also towards purchasing more forest land to add to Carbonland DAO treasury.

Over time each CLD will represent more and more forest land conserved and protected over time. For example if theoretically each CLD right now represented 3 square feet of forest land, because of the sustainable revenue from carbon removal credits it could grow to 6 square feet per CLD, then 9 square feet, and so on. Carbonland DAO can keep purchasing more forest land without funds from CLD sales because of CRC revenue.

What you can do with our Governance token (CLD)

Holding CLD offers many benefits and unique Ecotourism opportunities.

You can stake your CLD in lottery pools where you can win passes to visit and stay nights at properties owned by Carbonland DAO. And jackpots lotteries to win one of a kind all expenses paid vacations to spend time in nature.

You can vote with your CLD on where in the world you want Carbonland DAO to purchase forest land to conserve and protect. CLD holders can submit properties for Carbonland DAO Managers to review, and if properties meet criteria needed for conservation easement, they would go up for public vote to use treasury funds to purchase.

You can brag about your CLD holdings since they are in a way a badge of honor, in that they represent real forest land that has been locked into perpetual conservation to create old growth forests for future generations. Your part of the reason forests won’t go extinct.

3401,turning-tables-into-charts-my-e-book-readers-feat,"Hey frens,

TLDR; *Turning tables into charts while reading e-books*

I'm trying to come up with a design that automatically turns tables into charts. This feature is an attempt to make reading e-books more humane. As you might already know, getting to know what's going on in a numerical table without studying the corrosponding chart is tyrannous. Right know no e-book reader offers a feature to turn a table into a chart while reading an e-book on computers. I have been working on my e-book reading software since 2018 and have added features that I thought might be of some help for users who read books on computer displays. Imagine you are reading an e-book, you read on and then face a numerical table that occupies almost half a page without a chart to show the trend. Now, you gotta extract the data(which is also difficult in state of the art pdf readers), put it in an excel like app, get the resulting chart, smell the trend, and finally head back to reading the rest of the material. What I'm trying to achieve is an automated table to chart mechanism where users could see the corrosponding chart for a table with a simple click. Sort of an auto-hide floating pane over the table.
This feature is `no crypto` at all but indeed a `public goods` attempt to make e-book readers more human friendly. The Linux app is live on [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/readaratus) and the source code is available at [Github](https://github.com/rezahsnz/readaratus). I can thrive on $500-700 a month of full-time work on this feature. I think it would take 1-1.5 years to get this feature up and so I'm humbly asking for `one $eth` for the next 6 months. Should I fail to raise any funds, I have to continue hacking on Gitcoin. 

Love ya'all!
Cheers,

537,qed,"Projects such as the Milennium Prize Problems exist to steer mathematicians to work on problems that are (or were at some point) deemed important by the wider community. Essentially, some people want certain mathematical statements proven, and are thus willing to pay money to whoever succeeds in proving them. 


But how does the Clay Mathematics Institute determine who was successful in proving a problem? How do we know that paper X is indeed a valid proof of statement Y? The answer is peer review. If enough reputable mathematicians claim that X indeed proves Y, the prize will be payed out.


In recent years however, more and more people are taking interest in a new way of doing maths - by using programming languages! Some time ago, some brilliant logicians have noticed that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between mathematical statements and their proofs on one hand, and computer programs and their types on the other. What this means is that with a powerful enough computer language, one can define a statement one wants proven simply by defining a type in the language. The exercise of proving the statement then becomes one of constructing the value of the newly defined type. A big advantage of this approach is that we no longer need peer review to judge correctness of proofs! A computer algorithm can check if a given value (the proof) has the claimed type (the statement). If the type-checking algorithm returns true, we can be sure we have a proof of the statement on our hands!


There are many proof-languages out there today. The one we really like however, is Formality. It is fast, efficient, and it can run on the EVM. 


Taking all of this into account, an idea emerges. We could use Ethereum to create a trustless variant of the Milennium Prize Problems. A smart contract where anyone can contribute money towards a mathematical statement they want proven. Whoever is first to show a valid proof of a statement to the contract is paid the bounty on it. And the contract can judge the validity of the proofs itself.


However, checking the type of any non-trivial value fully on-chain would quickly exceed the block gas limit. But there exists a way of doing computations that exceed the block gas limit on chain - we can use the Truebit verification game to do that. We are already building EMO, a Truebit implementation with a generic machine backend. 


In this grant we seek funding for developing the Formality type-checker backend for EMO. We want to open the world of mathematics to everyone, regardless of their background. Help us decentralise maths!

955,fundingwiki,"Is a multi-purpose crowdfunding platform to connect ideas, workers, communicators and funders. Anyone can adopt one or more roles at any time!

Traditional crowdfunding platforms have two well-differentiated participation roles: promoter and funders.
The promoter must do several tasks:
 must innovate, that is, must have an idea;
 must propose yourself to do it and
 must act as a communicator for that idea to encourage the funders.
Funding.wiki breaks with that old logic to make the process of making new projects more dynamic:

Funding.wiki is at the same time an Idea Bank, a Job Board, an Investment Source, and a Personal or Collective Task Manager so that good ideas are quickly identified and carried out as soon as possible ♥

🏫 School's in Session
🌞 Summer Activity Update
⚙ Fall Workshops 
🤑 NFT Fundraising Auction

Full-time, in-person school is back in session!! What a thrill after 2 mindboggling years, our students began the '21-22 academic year on Sept 2nd. Despite the COVID protocols in place and continued strangeness of the entire experience, the joy of social interaction on day 1 was forefront. Kids playing and squealing and interacting and failing and all the things missing during distance learning were on full display from launch. 
But let's not forget Digital Literacy and NFT Minting 👇

Our summer NFT creation workshops were a success via remote participation and occasional IRL interaction. The students continued to learn the fundamental mechanics of transforming images to digital format then to NFT using a variety of softwares and platforms. Students were also able to successfully sell their digital art NFT's to raise funds for their school & the digital literacy program. The more advanced students also started diving into non-static NFTs like audio, video, and GIFs. More on that below.

This Fall, we will continue with 2 additional NFT workshops and ongoing 1-on-1 remote support as needed. We will dive deeper into the non-static realm, generating GIFs and other animated digital art for our concurrent, ongoing NFT Fundraiser. More interested students will be given the resources to explore the multiple emerging use cases of NFTs beyond art. 

As in previous grant rounds, the students are hosting a concurrent NFT Auction site on Unique.One Network (on xDai) showcasing their artwork, memes, and digital learnings. Have a look at the students' portfolio, make a purchase, and help support digital literacy, artistic expression, and ALTRUISM THROUGH PARTICIPATION. Keep an eye out for new student NFTs 👇

We are excited to continue our GR 9 Kids Code module --> NFT EDUCATION. 

After an arduous 1.5 yrs of distance learning and 2 months of a stressful, complicated return to partial in-person learning, our school's last day of classes is this week, June 17. We have been busy educating interested students about digital assets, with specific focus on the rapidly expanding world of NFTs. It is simply mind-boggling how young minds can pick up on new ideas and technologies, and we have made some excellent strides. Your GR 9 contributions made all of this progress possible. #GRATITUDE 

We hope to build upon students' progress and interests through the summer of 2021 with continued individual support sessions as well as 2 group syncs for interested newcomers. After such difficult times and a much anticipated ""return to normal"" for the start of the '21/22 school year in August,  maintaining summer continuity will be vital to the students' continuing interests in digital assets and their multitude of use cases, including NFTs. 

All of the pieces of our GR 9 project will be continued for GR 10 (see below)! That includes donation reward NFTs & Student-created NFT Fundraising Auction. Thank you for helping support digital literacy, artistic expression, and ALTRUISM THROUGH PARTICIPATION.

Description
We are excited to launch a new Kids Code module for GR9 --> NFT EDUCATION

With Non-Fungible Tokens so hot right now, we thought this a great opportunity to:
-Introduce NFTs as a medium for digital art and content
-Enable students to convert their existing paper art to digital art
-Enable students to create new and exciting digital art pieces
-Auction student-created NFTs to raise funds for their school
-ALTRUISM through PARTICIPATION

Grant contributions will support:
-Educational material development
-NFT conversion & creation
-Fundraising with student-created NFTs

We minted our first donation rewards NFTs back in 2019 as Happy Kids Dirty Hands & are excited to share our knowledge and history with AM Winn students. In doing so, we aim to enable artistic expression, digital literacy, and student-led fundraising capacity.

As always, contributions will directly support the AmwFund General Fund. NFT Education will be implemented free of cost with donated human hours & materials costs. We are volunteers!

NFT Education is a continuation of our Kids Code module under the ongoing Pandemic Pods & Distance Learning Grant, a key component of the AmwFund Fundraising Ecosystem.

Pandemic Pods 
Pandemic pods — also called micro-schools or nano-schools — are small groups of students who learn together outside the classroom but still in person. Some pods are hiring tutors to teach a child’s school curriculum; some pods are sharing teaching duties among parents. Other families are opting out of their kids’ schools entirely and treating a pod like a home-schooling co-op with an agreed-upon curriculum.

What Parents Need to Know About Learning Pods

Why Pods?
Most common sentiment during the first week of Distance Learning, Zoom marathons, and technical glitches...

"" My favorite part about school is my friends. This school does not have my friends. This sucks!""

How to Form a Pandemic Pod

Kids Code
Kids Code is an ongoing effort, started in the Spring of 2020 prior to COVID-19, to teach rudimentary coding skills to interested students 3rd grade and above. Portions of this grant revenue will support continuation of the Kids Code pilot program in a distance learning framework. Despite all of the challenges associated with Distance Learning, we see this is a natural opportunity to improve students' digital literacy and introduce them to the magical world of computer coding. 

As interest and proficiency grow, we will begin to include blockchain subject matter by exploring and implementing open source software. Ultimately, students will run, or heavily participate in, the AmwFund Giving Ecosystem through their coding practice and creativity.

Our vision from the outset has been threefold:

1. Generate school revenue with OSS & DLT platforms (Happy Kids Dirty Hands)
2. Educate our school community about the benefits and potential of digital assets as a revenue stream and more broadly (AmwFund)
3. Extrapolate the AmwFund Giving Ecosystem to a broader Public Education audience and user base (Raisin Education)

Portions of this grant revenue will allow our community (students, teachers, staff, parents) to continue the development of both our internal revenue platforms and a more generic donation ecosystem targeting broader Public Education non-profits and individual school use cases.

Now more than ever, we are relying on AmwFund's OSS & DLT implementations to bolster our school's financial future and help support our students through already extraordinarily difficult times. Our digital asset revenue streams are now effectively our primary fundraising mechanism for the indeterminate future.

Help us help our students and entire community:
*Interact socially
*Learn to code, learn basic DLT and OSS concepts
*Implement & expand the AmwFund Giving Ecosystem
*Promote altruism through doing

Distance Learning continues for the foreseeable future. The challenges are many, opportunities arise. Gitcoin Grants CLR matching rounds are an important piece of our support revenue. Our #GRATITUDE is eternal.

1543,certy-certify-original-digital-content-on-ethereu,"Demand for qualified digital content creators is at an all-time high and as creators we are concerned with ensuring what we create whether it is an email, document or image as examples, remains and is used as we intended and is not misused in any way. One of the big advantages of the digital world is that digital content/data is easy to view, copy, manipulate and process. Its STRENGTH is also its WEAKNESS. So the question is how do we protect the integrity of digital content/data we create?

Certy is the application that allows you to certify Digital Contents of any extension on the Ethereum Blockchain. You can create an immutable record by notarising any kind of file (Pdf, images, projects, music, video etc.) in a tamperproof way on the Blockchain. After notifying your content, Certy will issue a document that represents the immutable record stored in the database managed by smart contract that ensures the successful certification with these details:
Encrypted fingerprint of your digital content
Address of your wallet
Memo label
Hash of the related transaction
Timestamp

Then, through Smart Contract, Certy allows you to easily and automatically check the compliance of a Content with the Certified Original. Just entering the public key of the certifier wallet and the content to verify. Certy automatically makes the comparison of the fingerprint on the database managed on Blockchain by the Smart Contract and returns the result, this verification is fully automated and not manually as other similar applications do.
Certy is addressed to national and international audience, it can be used by different categories of users as Certificators, Auditors, Notaries, Lawyers, etc. Reasons why are many and important, for example to ensure on the Blockchain that a digital content was in possession of a specific figure or entity at a given time (Proof of existence) or to ensure that digital content verification is in compliance with the original content notarized by the certifier.

Why we need to certify Digital Data & Content?
Want to be able to prove ownership and copyright of digital content
Want to know if content published on web site or issued has been tampered with
Want users of content/data to be able to trust it
Want to be able to prove to authorities and management that the information is in compliance with process, standards and regulations
Want to be able to use it as irrefutable evidence of ownership and the authenticity of their original content or data as evidence in a court.
People, Organisations and 3rd parties make important decisions based on digital data/content, these decisions can have negative consequences so creating confidence and an audit trail for digital data can create that confidence and history
Should there be a question, concern, audit or challenge to the integrity, authenticity and provenance of digital content/data being able to prove beyond doubt these elements will avoid issues and possibly penalties.

What is the Certy’s added value?
A smart contract that manage the certification of a digital content and its owner address called certifier and automatically check for the compliance with an original one notarized by that certifier.
Certy also provides a tool to verify the compliance of a content to the certified original version, because the data stored in smart contracts are fully verifiable and unalterable over time.

Prerequisites:
Mozilla Firefox browser or Google Chrome
Metamask installed, a digital ethereum wallet. You will need to put ether into it in order to certify digital content.

Why Certy ?
·        Proof of Property who is the Certifying Owner of the Digital Content
·        Proof of Compliance of a Digital Content with the original Certificate
·        Proof of Existency of a Digital Content at a specific time (timestamp)

Please Note:
In order to notarize your content forever in the Ethereum Mainnet, Certify Content function will send a fee of 0.001 Eth to a B2Lab wallet, Check Content and Content List are free.
To avoid long waits we suggest to set gas price higher than 4 gwei

4310,science-fund,"Update - June 2022
Dear supporters! We're very excited about the progress we made in the past months  building out our first climate focussed funding experiment. We will update the grant home page in due course so you will learn about our progress and the revolutionary funding allocation mechanisms we are planning to experiment with. 

Reimagining the path to discovery
The goal of Science Fund is to empower scientists freely, openly, and rapidly pursue their best scientific ideas. To achieve this, we are reimagining how discovery is funded. No grant applications. Transparent, traceable funding records. Rapid funding cycles that support more ideas early, and continue funding what’s working. Most importantly, we are growing the foundation of support for science by creating an unparalleled donor experience that lets you participate in the exciting process of scientific discovery. To this end Science Fund is developing a DApp to turn donating to science into a ""minting and collecting Science NFTs"" experience. Donors receive an immutable, time-stamped proof of their donation. Over time they can track the evolving impact through blockchain backed audit trails.



How it works
Donors contribute to funding pools opened for a specific topic with an amount of their choosing.
In return donors receive a NFT receipt (a ""Science Funding Token"", SFT)




Curated Funding Pool
Each donation is added to a chosen funding pool. Researchers can apply through our open protocol with their track record from early published groundwork. As new results emerge from funded work, we update the NFTs metadata.

Impact Tracing
We revolutionize the role and experience of donors: Their NFTs are a personal key to unlock an continuously evolving experience data trail about their donation’s impact.

Future Participation
The NFT receipts become the key to future interactions with the scientists they supported and endless new forms of participatory governance to the field they contributed to can evolve.

How do we allocate funding to scientists?

When researchers apply to one of the topic specific funding pools they are not giving away their best ideas. They simply need to share their most influential scientific work (any already published scientific artifact they created such as a publication, preprint or even just a cool dataset) to a given pool. Selected scientists's works then form the basis of a growing evidence trail that is matched to the donor's minted NFT. The NFT receipts become the key to future interactions among scientists and donors and open a universe of endless new possibilities of mutual exchange and future interactions.

Show me this actually works!
We are already working on a dApp that you will soon be able to experience at sciencefund.io to mint Science Fund NFTs and trace the impact they made over time. 

In the meantime we have created a MVP of the donation NFT minter and NFT tracer here that works on Rinkeby. Try it!

https://science-fund.herokuapp.com/



You find the code here


Our first funding drive kicked off on December 1st 2021.
For the first funding drive we have decided to launch it as a traditional token sale on OpenSea on the Polygon chain. NFTs were created that each carry a fragment of the COVID-19 reference genome as a payload. You can check it out here: https://opensea.io/collection/science-fund-pandemic-data

Funds raised through this sale will be donated to scientists working on pandemic preparedness.

Google controls us. The content we see in Google search is decided by few engineers in Google.

Things which we cannot do in Google search
- Rank webpages on popularity of the webpage less and relevance with search term more or the vice versa.
- Rank webpages based on credible backlinks more and social media popularity less to reduce exaggerated news.
- Consider you haven't read any news for the 6 months. What will you do? If you go to Google News, you will be shown the recent articles/posts only. You will not have the ability to pick say top 10 popular content in the past 6 years.

In general, we do not have the power to modify the ranking parameters. It also applies to ranking of posts in social media sites like Facebook, Linkedin and Twitter.

So we are working on a search engine/recommendation engine where the ranking data is stored in public database. Other users can use that data to build their own ranking algorithms.

Handshake is a completely community-run decentralized blockchain built to dismantle ICANN's monopoly on top-level domains (.com, .net, .org, etc. are all top-level domains controlled by ICANN, who charges an $185,000 evaluation fee for new ones) and improve internet security by replacing Certificate Authorities. Read this 2-minute article for a quick introduction to Handshake: Why are we still renting domains? You can also read the Handshake whitepaper for a deeper dive.

Handshake also helps protect and decentralize Ethereum at the internet level. Some Handshake Development Funds are going towards porting domains to use ENS as well.

This community run development fund is the only source of non-VC, non-dilutive grants funding in the HNS community. Our goal is to support and empower our fellow open source developers and creators in their mission to create a free and open internet on the dweb.

Development Fund Structure
- 80% of funds go to independent creators and core devs working on the HNS stack on a monthly basis. We maintain a spreadsheet of grant transactions and an announcement is published in The Shake every time grants are distributed with details of grantees and amounts.
- 20% of funds will be held in reserve to fund bounties that tackle long term projects on the core protocol. If we cannot give away the full 80% of monthly grants, those funds will be rolled over into this reserve. Reserves are held in the multisig.
 
View multisig on Etherscan.

Grant Recipients
We are open to giving grants to anyone working in the Handshake community. We primarily focus on these areas:
- Core Handshake protocol development
- Domain management tools (e.g. registries, DNS records)
- Wallets
- Browser integrations
- Auction tools
- Educational content
- Identity solutions
- Community growth

Donate in PAN tokens!
On top of Gitcoin grant matching, Panvala will also match all donations made in PAN tokens by about ~9x your donation amount. Please donate in PAN tokens to maximize your impact!!!

Fund Advisors
At the moment it's just me but I hope others in the Handshake community will reach out to be added to the multisig and eventually form a DAO.

Who am I? Just your friendly neighborhood anarchist :) I'm a Link Marine, Etherean, Handshaker, et. all. I suggested Handshake devs make their own grants but they were unwilling for various reasons so I’m taking it upon myself to get funding for them. I’m in crypto because I don’t want to trust the people I’m giving my money to but in donating to this grant, you will have to trust me to do the right thing with your money. It’s hypocritical but it’s the most frictionless way to get funding to the various independent contributors in the Handshake community. I believe the Handshake community is building a core component to a trustless, censorship resistant, and open internet and want to make sure they get the funding they need to do so.

Handshake FOSS Airdrop
This is information is unrelated to the grant but might be valuable to you :)

$10.2M was raised for Handshake, all of which was then [donated to the FOSS community](https://handshake.org/grant-sponsors/). Furthermore, to encourage open source developers to build on Handshake, a decentralized airdrop of about 4,200 Handshake tokens (~$700 @ $0.15) each was also created for ~175,000 Github developers to claim. If you had 15 or more followers on GitHub during the week of February 4th, 2019, chances are you’re eligible for the airdrop, which you can use Namebase’s airdrop claim tool for.

Our mission is to build a culture of giving that rewards and empowers those who give - to projects, to societies and to the world. We are connecting for-good projects to the revolutionary funding opportunities of the Ethereum ecosystem with free, open & accessible donation applications, and a community of public goods-focused builders & givers.



 
Giveth TRACE is the OG Giveth Donation Application, built in 2017. It pioneered the first Ethereum bridge, overcoming the scaling and gas issues of the time by bridging Ethereum mainnet to Rinkeby testnet. After 4 years of hard work and immense dedication, the Giveth TRACE DApp was officially launched July 2021. Our platform empowers for-good projects to create highly customizable online representations to attract real supporters.
 
Projects on TRACE can spin up multiple funding pathways (“Traces”) that put the power in the hands of donors to decide where they want their donations to go. The Giveth TRACE system allows Givers and Project owners to keep track of donation flows and provides checkstops to prevent funds being misused. Projects on the DApp go through a rigorous verification process made to give our users confidence when making donations on the platform.
 
Donations to Giveth TRACE will help fund DApp development as it continues to thrive post-beta. In particular, we are looking for funding to take Giveth TRACE to the next level and make it accessible on Gnosis Chain and other sidechains. Most importantly, Giveth TRACE is currently pointing toward a revamp, where we work on solving some of the current issues with costly gas.

To date, Giveth TRACE has facilitated $2 Million USD of donations for countless for-good projects and has spent $40k USD on gas fees in support of those projects.

4151,silent-auth-the-de-facto-multi-factor-authenticat,"Silent Auth is a multi-factor authentication suite being built at Silence Laboratories that reimagines privacy-preserving, peer-to-peer, and usable authentication among users and devices by combining cryptography, sensor fusion, and design science. The Silent Auth and Shard framework enables a secure, invisible, and effortless user experience for humans and machines using web3. It also adds the ability to split/shard keys across devices for social recovery. 
What's wrong with current authenticators and authentication systems:
As cyber-physical security and design researchers, we've built Silent Auth keeping in mind the state of vulnerabilities and user struggles in currently popular methods such as text-based passwords, QR codes, 2FA, passwordless authentication, and push notifications supported by Identity and Access Management (IAM) providers. 
We've exposed some of these vulnerabilities (in SMS-based OTP, TOTP, and push-based auth) and published them in top security conferences (such as IEEE Euro S&P 2021), and publicized it in our blog for the community.



Here is how Silent Auth revamps the authentication ecosystem:
A combination of extreme security along with usability gives Silent Auth a clear edge over all the existing authentication products, protocols, and practices in the space.
The security is based on a combination of the following proofs: proof of position, proximity, legitimate possession, liveliness,  GPS-independent colocation, and proximity-only authentication.
There is no code to type, no app to open, and no secrets to remember. Authentication should not be a cognitive burden for the human mind.
Silent Auth continuously adapts its security models based on the risk of capital and trust in the nature of the transaction involved.
The risk estimation engine uses a trifecta of network layer adaptation, the nature of the transaction, and physical layer context adaptations.
Silent Auth introduces continuous and passwordless authentication based on the context of the transaction as well as the user's physical environment. 

In web3, SilentAuth is to support different kinds of off-chain and on-chain authentication use cases, including standard wallet sign-ins (such as MetaMask / WalletConnect) and also emerging ones such as sign-in with Ethereum (EIP-4361), hardware wallets, multi-sig +  social recovery wallets, and token-based authentication for both retail users and institutions/trading desks/custodians/governments/critical infrastructures. 

SilentAuth is coupled with Silent Shard - a multi-party computation (MPC) framework for social recovery. This solves a major pain point in the crypto ecosystem: the loss of private keys (popularly through phishing scams or via malware in browser/wallets).

Silent Shard is a fusion of MPC-based TSS (Threshold Signature Schemes) and Silent Auth’s proofs which together enables a true decentralized and non-custodial signature and authentication support. The signature process (involving sharded secrets) is distributed among user-controlled nodes/parties such that exposure of one of the secrets will not threaten/drain the assets.
											


The proofs of proximity, colocation, legitimate possession, liveliness, identity, and peer-to-peer group secret sharing brings secure and usable web3 applications to the real cyber-physical world. As a core infrastructure-level project, Silent Auth helps serve every aspect of the web3 stack:
Wallets: much improved usability and security for both software and hardware wallets in the form of no-UI, instant authentication, social recovery in case of theft, loss, etc.
dApps: improving signing/verifying/transacting mechanisms across the board for on/off/cross-chain authentication.
Community: creating secure, shared, sybil-resistant experiences in DAOs with social recovery for individual/multi-sig wallets.
DeFi / CeFi: easily integrable SDK that can be installed in the web apps to improve non-custodial security.
Institutions: multi-factor authentication security for high-value / high-risk transactions by trading desks, custodians, critical infrastructures, and governments.
Zero Knowledge Proofs: Proving liveliness, legitimate possession, identity, colocation of device without sharing secrets or personally identifiable information is important for all web-based applications going forward.
Metaverse / gaming: the above proofs ensure integrity of the game mechanics (by preventing cheating with botting) for all human players in the shared metaverse while enabling secure, social experiences.
Physical world crypto applications: Native support for creating decentralized infrastructure for geospatial applications like ecosystem monitoring, credential verification, live events such as ticket authentication for concerts, conferences, interactive museum experiences, mobility, delivery, community token / NFT-orchestrated events, etc.

SilentAuth was presented and appreciated in the recent Kernel Showcase and won the overall prizes at the Singapore Blockchain Innovation Challenge 2021.

Team: Silence Laboratories has been founded by a strong technical and business team including PhDs and researchers (CS/Mobile Computing at SUTD/NUS, Singapore, and UIUC, USA) along with co-founders from CSAIL MIT, globally top-ranked CTF teams, Goldman Sachs, MBAs from IIMs, and crypto-native stewards from DAOs and communities like Gitcoin, Kernel, and Token Engineering Commons. 

This is summarized in the figure below:

Hackathon DAO is a decentralized community to support global hackathons on meaningful technical problems and innovations.

Why Hackathon? Why DAO?


Hackathon has undoubtedly proven its capability of boosting innovation and cooperation. However, big companies dominated hackathons in recent years and the voices of grass-root hackers are becoming a comparably small minority now. Most of the hackathons have lost many of its excitement, creativity and energy.

Through funding hackathons, we want to gather a group of enthusiastic hackers with great technical skills and vision and further boost the open-source community and innovations, where:
👉 Hackers themselves can propose and decide what are the real problems to solve.
👉 Hackers can connect with and inspire each other.
👉 Valuable contributions will be supported financially and operationally.


What We Do?


To financially and operationally support and liberate global hackers and hackathon organizers (especially open-source repo maintainers) and focus on truly valuable technical problems and improvements, we
👉 Hold seasonal grants to fund meaningful hackathons.
👉 Maintain a hackathon playbook to share (almost) everything about hackathons.
👉 Organize an online community of top hackers and hackathon organizers to actively discuss the (most) valuable tech problems needed to be solve.
👉 Generate content to help more developers onboard Web3.0, crypto and quantum computing.

1901,dcent-matic-polygon-nft-product-authentication-sy,"D¢ENT Co. is partnering with Matic (now Polygon) to create an automated physical product authentication system. Every product sale will result in the minting of a unique NFT that functions as equal parts sale receipt, certificate of authenticity, and tradeable collectible. The NFT will contain the product details/variables and be viewable with dynamic attributes on OpenSea. For instance, customers will be able to see the current rarity and circulating supply of a specific jacket with the variables ""Blue"" and ""XL"".

Customers can then take ownership of their Authentication NFT through a process inspired by the procurement process of TestNet ETH. The buyer publishes a social media post with specific information and submits it to our system to register/authenticate the product. Upon confirmation the NFT is instantly transferred to the customer's wallet. This process also helps the retailer by incentivizing every product sold to be shared on social media.

By minting on Matic this process can be done quickly and cheaply at no extra cost to the customer. This solution also leverages the forthcoming Matic + OpenSea integration for frictionless and gas-saving NFT experiences.

NFT-PAS for Public Good
Like all software solutions created by *Invisible Hand Ventures, our NFT-PAS will be an open-source solution for online retailers and manufacturers to integrate cutting edge blockchain features into their operations.

546,1up-world,"Hello, World!

We’re 1UP and we’re here to reward your community for their value added contributions.

Seeing as this is our first ever Gitcoin Grant proposal, we’d encourage people to brush up on this primer to learn more about us, our roots and our future plans!

But, for now - here’s the TLDR

What is 1UP?

1UP is gamified reputation system that currently consists of the following elements:

A bot that can be added to any Telegram chat (soon to be other chat interfaces)
A website displaying point information (1up.world), where points can be submitted to a DAO to earn tokens or voting power. 

Users simply add @oneupworld_bot to their community, and dish out 1UPs using the /1up @username command. Members don’t even need to be onboarded to web3 to use it. 

For the time being, 1UP is only tied to a single 1UP DAO, but the idea is to allow 1UP to be used by various DAOs, each running their independant game. 

Ownership of the game is distributed by the users of 1UP. The more you play, the more of the network you own.

What’s the Point?

As communities start collecting points, we’re looking to instill game-like features to allow those users to redeem them for top secret swag.

Through the advent of digital characters, 1UP unlocks the potential for community members to flex their newly redeemed items among their peers.

More than the swag itself, 1UP leaderboards are a great proxy for recognizing value added contributions, all of which are likely to play an evolving role in the governance of our communities using 1UP.

Why Donate?

So far, 1UP has been funded by a MetaCartel grant as well as funding from DAOstack’s Genesis DAO. With this funding, 1UP has partnered with the legendary Raid Guild to build out our foundations. 

In the next few weeks, we’re looking to start integrating our bots into a various communities, and start work on the actual “game” that will fuel the entire ecosystem. 

With the power of CLR matching, we can use donations to tap into more communities, effectively using the funding for additional development, design and marketing efforts.

If you’re keen to get involved, donating to our grant and joining the 1UP Telegram channel is a great way to start, not to mention - adding 1UP in your community!.

Thank You.

767,dytokens,"The DyDx platform allows users to place margin trading orders. In order to go long on Ether or BTC using leverage, the traders must borrow DAI from the others in the system to buy more Ether or Bitcoin. We as lenders can then make a profit for the interest paid by the borrowers.

DyDx is different from Compound and Aave because you can place leverage trades within the system which is why it is growing in popularity recently.









User cases for DyTokens

Gas Pricing
One of the major use cases for DyDAI is to avoid paying the withdraw and deposit gas fees every time you want to change your DAI position.
 Every deposit and withdrawal costs more 400,000 gas, which is about $0.84(at a rate of 10), than using DyDAI to hold your DAI in DyDX position.
When chasing the highest interest rate this becomes a great cost.


Set protocol
Set protocol allows you to create a basket of tokens with your own rebalancing rules. 
DyDAI can be included in sets that use DAI to hedge when the sets rules detect a fall in a cryptocurrency.
DyDAI can be added to a set which involves all yield tokens and has rules set to chase the highest interest rate. For example, a set containing cDAI, aDAI, CHAI, and DyDAI can be made.


Uniswap
Uniswap is a decentralized exchange that eliminates trusted intermediaries and unnecessary forms of rent extraction, allowing for fast, efficient trading. Uniswap is based on using liquidity pools for trading and the price is determined by x * y = k where x and y are the reserve balances and k is always constant.
In Uniswap V1, you can create or add liquidity to a DyDAI and ETH pool which will allow you to hedge your ETH position with an interest-earning token. In return for providing liquidity, you would also earn 0.3% of each trade executed.
In Uniswap V2, you can create or add liquidity between two interest-earning tokens such as DyDAI and cDAI, or DyDAI and aDAI. This will maintain profits from both Compound and DyDx independent from ETH or BTC volatility. You would also earn 0.25% of each trade.


Balancer
Balancer is in a way like Uniswap. They both use liquidity pools as a mechanism for decentralized trading. How balancer differs is that you are able to create liquidity pools of multiple tokens instead of just a pair. This allows for the pool liquidity token to act like an index fund where traders trade to leverage arbitrage opportunities.
You can create (or provide liquidity) to a pool that holds all interest-bearing token like aDAI, iDAI(RIP), cDAI, CHAI, etc. Supplying liquidity hear mean you hold an index of all the tokens in the pool. Rebalancing is done by traders according to market forces while you will receive 0.2% of each trade.


Idle Finance
Idle Finance uses aDAI and cDAI at the moment to chase the highest interest rate. It works by rebalancing anytime someone interacts with the contract.
Idle Finance can incorporate DyDAI to add DyDx interest rates as a part of its interest rate chasing yielding higher returns.

Trust wallet
Trust Wallet is multi-cryptocurrency wallet that shows us our total holding as well as being a DApp explorer.
When we invest into a DApp such as DyDx we are not show the value of our holdings accurately because our DAI is in the DyDx protocol and not in our wallet.
Instead, investing in DyDAI we can see the accurate value of our holdings. (Assuming Trust wallet adds the price oracle for DyDAI)


Usage of Funds

Rainforest Foundation’s model of empowering indigenous communities living in the Amazon rainforest to utilize satellite data, drones and smartphones for monitoring territories against illegal deforestation has proven successful at reducing deforestation and is backed by a scientific study proving its efficacy.

Rainforest Direct is a new online platform that enables individuals and companies to give results-based payments to participating indigenous communities that are effectively protecting or replanting forest. It applies blockchain technology towards creating a transparent, immutable, and trusted record of the impact of reforestation and conservation efforts and powers the creation of a sustainable results-based flow of funding to vulnerable communities. Direct payments to communities will be based on evidence from satellite data that projects have had a successful impact.

The communities this initiative will serve live in extreme poverty, sustaining themselves by hunting, fishing, gathering and tending to small farm plots. Apart from this, they occasionally gain income through selling fish or logging. The communities have suffered from and are vulnerable to outside threats to their natural resources, particularly illegal mining, logging, and coca cultivation. 

They are vulnerable to these threats because there is virtually no government presence in this remote region, and sometimes they are forced to participate in unsustainable activities in order to survive, as they need some income for basic necessities. This program will serve entire communities, counting on the participation of women, children, youth, and the elderly, ensuring collective buy-in and ownership of the program. 

We aim to demonstrate this evidence-based model of investment in frontline communities as a sustainable solution to the climate crisis and leverage investment to scale this program across forest communities throughout the Amazon and beyond.",https://rainforestfoundation.org/,977,986,280,2,0,https://github.com/rainforestfoundation,1

We do this by running an intensive, four-month leadership program for 15-20 year olds seeking to be and build the future of web3 x social impact; supporting them after they graduate the program; and producing media that inspires and amplifies web3 x social impact work.

The ultimate objectives of the Dream DAO are to, by 2030:
Have directly supported 2,000+ Gen Z Builders in learning how to leverage web3 to accelerate the flourishing of their communities and the world, and
Have inspired 1 million more Gen Zers outside of the DAO to explore the intersection of web3 and social impact

The Dream DAO...
1) Empowers Gen Z civic superheroes—who have demonstrated an interest in web3 and a capacity and willingness to address impediments to human flourishing—by...
Providing them funding that removes financial barriers to pursuing meaningful learning opportunities in web3
Providing them training in web3 fundamentals and how to leverage the power of web3 to make change
Embedding them in a community of peers and established leaders who can supercharge their ability to grow as leaders and make a difference in the world (by creating access to mentorship, job opportunities, a platform to launch, etc)

✅ Our open-source library is being used in most Ethereum based iOS Apps. 

🎉 2.5.0 version release & latest updates:
The library has been fixed and now it’s fully supported in three systems:
🍫1. Cocoapods building
👷 2. Carthage building
🦢 3. Swift Package Manager building
The library can equally operate in any of these systems (library users can choose the most suitable way for data extraction)
We Added github-actions pipeline (each change in the library code is being reviewed automatically on GitHub)
We clarified contributions guidelines. Now it’s much easier for the community to contribute to our library. 
Standardized web3swift code guidelines - HackMD link https://hackmd.io/8bACoAnTSsKc55Os596yCg

Why we are applying for this Grant:

We've developed web3swift as a side project. It falls in the category of public goods and isn't monetizable. Nevertheless it's useful for the ETH ecosystem.
Now to keep the project up to date, to be on the wave of the Ethereum updates, and actively support them in the library, we want to move it to crowdfunding support. 
Matter Labs would like to eventually make web3swift a completely community-driven project. Right now, Petr Korolev (one of the co-founders) has volunteered to become a full-time maintainer. He should be considered the main responsible person for this grant.

Who we are:

web3swift was originally founded by the team of 3 developers/cryptographers and Ethereum contributors, multi-ETH-Hackathon-winners:
ETHParis (Pyromania)
ETHDenver zDai (2019)+ ios-smart-contact-interactions (2018), 
ETHSanFrancisco - Advanced DEX tools
ETHBerlin - The Game Of Snarks

and recipients of ETH Foundation Grants (Wave 5)

Core team:

Petr Korolev: Creator and Architect, tech coordinator(https://github.com/skywinder). The responsible person for the whole development process of this library.
Alex Vlasov: Cryptographer & researcher (https://github.com/shamatar). Do the hard-lifting code tasks with fundamental cryptography implementation.
Anton Grigorev: Core contributor, original co-maintainer (https://github.com/BaldyAsh). Devote free time and experience to the project
Yaroslav: Team-lead & contributor, build whole CI/CD process. His project is supported by an Ethereum Foundation grant

Minor roadmap (2 months plan)
Code stability improvements
1. We will add CI/CD pipeline for building as a dependency
(https://github.com/skywinder/web3swift/issues/434) 
2. Add Cocoapods to CI/CD pipeline
(https://github.com/skywinder/web3swift/issues/433) 
3. Will make tests green
(https://github.com/skywinder/web3swift/issues/432) 

Code quality improvements
1. We will clarify documentation for ganache tests (simulates blockchain on a computer)
(https://github.com/skywinder/web3swift/issues/431)
2. Will make ganache tests setup 
(https://github.com/skywinder/web3swift/issues/430) 
3. All warnings in the code will be fixed
(https://github.com/skywinder/web3swift/issues/437)
4. Will add swiftlint config
(https://github.com/skywinder/web3swift/issues/436) 
5. Code quality guidelines will be added to the project
(https://github.com/skywinder/web3swift/issues/435)  

Major roadmap (6-9 months) 

We will mostly focus on technical debt and product usability
We will align our library with the latest Apple guidelines. The library structure will be more typical, natural for iOS developers (will Make more swift way API)
Apple has released development updates that make it easier to work with asynchronous events, we want to support it in our library
We will drop most of the outdated dependencies. The library will take up less space (easier implementation)
We will also drop down git size by dropping caches since it’s important for SPM library use cases
We will create a test environment with 2-3 test wallets. It will help our new users to understand how the solution works. 
At the same time we will optimise the space for our test environment which will make the downloading and implementation process easier

Future plans (1.5 years)
We will optimize and simplify our documentation. Will write documentation (comments in code) in [DocC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc) format, which will allow us to add online documentation, and give a nest egg to make interactive examples in docs in future

1429,kchannels,"Kchannels is a new payment channel platform for the Ethereum blockchain. It is non-custodial and trust-minimized, and its primary focus is on great UX and instant off-chain finality. Among other things, it is well suited for commerce use-cases (e.g. merchants and their customers).

Kchannels is available on Mainnet (and testnets) *today* with support for Ether and ERC-20 tokens.

Multi-Channels: A new channel construction

Kchannels utilizes a powerful new channel construction called a multi-channel. A multi-channel enables you to transact with anyone both within Kchannels and on the blockchain, and it also stores multiple assets in one place, so it can act as a lightweight hot wallet. You can also open as many as you want, but most people would really only need one for all their needs.

-- A channel can hold multiple assets, and it can send and receive multiple assets in a single transaction.
-- An unattended channel can still receive transactions, and all funds within it are safe. No need to watch the blockchain!
-- Deposits and withdrawals to/from Layer1 are fast and easy--no additional waiting beyond the time it takes to mine a block.
-- Most users only need a single channel--ever--for all their needs! A channel is free to create, and it only takes an instant.

Fast finality

Finality on Layer2 is hard; many Layer2 solutions can't guarantee that your transaction is confirmed and final for a long time after it seemingly completes. Others achieve finality by imposing significant requirements on their users, such as the need to monitor the blockchain at all times until the final on-chain settlement. In Kchannels a Layer2 transaction is truly final and confirmed as soon as it completes--instant off-chain finality for a very credit card-like experience--without imposing any additional burdens on the user.

Fast finality is an absolute necessity for many important use-cases that are currently not supported by the Ethereum ecosystem.

Designed from the Ground Up for Great UX

Imagine transacting in Web3 with the UX of Web2. Transact in Layer2 as if you were hitting the Stripe API; you make a simple call and you're done.

-- Minimal infrastructure requirements. No need to install any software, not even Geth.
-- No special token. There is no special token anywhere in the system.
-- No network. Kchannels avoids all the complexity of routing transactions through a public Layer2 network.
-- No channel balancing. Transactions are not bottlenecked by the need for funds elsewhere in the system; your transaction is always delivered with no intermediaries.
-- High Scalability. Kchannels can scale horizontally to support any throughput desired simply by adding additional hardware.
-- Channels are free. Channels are fast and free to open as they do not require transactions on Layer1. They also do not need to be funded to stay open.

...And everything else you expect from a payment channel solution

-- Fast transactions. No more waiting for blocks/confirmations; no more dealing with congestion.
-- Low fees. No more dealing with expensive and ever-changing gas prices.
-- Privacy. In-channel transactions are not visible on-chain.

An anonymous cabal of hackers have been exploiting Web3 projects and draining their funds. To save the Web3 ecosystem, a heroic group of top developers has joined forces to fight back. They've formed HackNone, an organization dedicated to hunting down Web3 hackers.

But HackNone has just received a tip! There are hackers masquerading amongst their members.

The honest devs must catch the hackers among them and vote to expel them from the organization. Unfortunately, because only the best devs are allowed as members, if a dev's project is exploited, that dev will be kicked out and banned from future votes.

Will the devs catch the hackers in time before their own projects are exploited? Or will the hackers take over HackNone and bring the Web3 world to its knees?

Gameplay
The game plays out much like the original game of Mafia, with Devs instead of Villagers, Hackers instead of the Mafia, and an Auditor instead of a Detective.

The biggest difference is that in ZK Mafia, secret identities will be randomly assigned and kept truly secret without the need for a trusted moderator to run the game. Hackers will remain hidden as they attack Dev after Dev. Daytime votes to remove members will only be publicly revealed once all votes are received.

Check out our website (coming soon) for more details on game mechanics.

Why
ZK Mafia provides a case study of the power of zero knowledge technology that is fun and accessible to a wider and less technical audience.

Can you build it without ZK? Yes. 
Can you build it better with ZK? 100%
We believe those 2 lines foreshadow our collective technological future, so let's build!

How
This is a new project, so some things are still being hashed out, but ZK Mafia will be on Layer 2, on either StarkNet or Aztec to take advantage of the scalability and privacy options afforded by ZK Rollups.

Aztec's L2 offers privacy by default, which simplifies the implementation, but they're still on testnet. StarkNet, on the other hand, just launched their shiny new Alpha version! However, because StarkNet doesn't support privacy out of the box, we'd have to use their ZK-STARK prover& verifier Ziggy.

We'll play with both and see which one we like more for this project. The more granular implementation details will be decided as we build.

If you're a zk afficionado, we welcome any ideas, feedback, or suggestions!

Who: grjte
Hello, I'm grjte! I like to build things.

In meatspace, I'm a person who has done things and even won things, but around here I'm a new pseudonymous entity. I began a deep dive into ZK on October 26th at the beginning of ZK Hack, using it as a personal bootcamp. Despite entering without any significant background in ZK or Cryptography, I won 2 of the puzzle writeups, and now I'm diving into building. My aim in the ZK space is to start with smaller, fun projects and work my way up to Bigger And More Serious Things.

For more about me, here's a madlib bio which is honest with the correct inputs:
I've been coding for over (_number_) (_time interval_)s. I've worked on backends, frontends, and compilers, for both public and private institutions. I've coded in (_number_) programming languages, including JavaScript/TypeScript, Solidity, and most recently dipping my toe into Rust. As an entrepreneur, I've run or founded (_number_) companies. I'm happiest when I'm learning and creating.

grjte, why is your github (nearly) empty?
I care deeply about privacy, which is part of what has driven me to join the ZK ecosystem. I've decided to hang out here pseudonymously, which means building up a new github and reputation from scratch ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Wish me luck, or contribute and help me do it faster 😉

3974,electronic-frontier-foundation,"For over 30 years, EFF has been the leading nonprofit advocate for the privacy and free speech rights of technology creators and ordinary users. Our team achieves success through impact litigation, policy analysis and education, grassroots activism, technology development, and support from the public. EFF's mission is to ensure that technology supports freedom, justice, and innovation for all people of the world.

Even in the fledgling days of the Internet, EFF understood that protecting access to technology was central to advancing freedom for all. In the years that followed, EFF used its fiercely independent voice to clear the way for open source software, encryption, security research, file sharing tools, and a world of emerging technologies. EFF’s work in the growing movement for web decentralization and the public interest internet is no different.

In order to combat the ever-consolidating power of corporate giants (and end the gatekeeping, surveillance, and censorship that often accompany them), many have looked toward blockchain-based technology and cryptocurrency for remedies. EFF is optimistic about the ability of digital currency to support independent community projects, route around financial censorship, and support independent journalists around the world. That is why EFF fought a poorly-defined cryptocurrency provision in the Biden Administration’s infrastructure bill that could create onerous requirements affecting user privacy, and EFF also introduced bright-line rules that Congress should adopt when developing cryptocurrency regulations; we’ve written extensively about the ways financial intermediaries censor legal speech; we submitted comments to FinCEN opposing the agency’s proposal for new privacy-invasive regulations of cryptocurrency transactions; and we’ve called for blockchain intermediaries to issue transparency reports and protect the rights of their users. While there are still many problems to solve in the blockchain ecosystem, the world needs thoughtful, user-focused advocates like EFF to help uncover the opportunities for public good.

While EFF is proud to be a leading voice in online rights debates, we’ve also created gratis and open source tools to enhance everyone’s freedom online. All of our work is funded by donations:

Atlas of Surveillance: Launched in collaboration with hundreds of EFF members and university students, the Atlas is the largest searchable database of U.S. law enforcement’s surveillance technologies.
Certbot: This software tool allows you to automatically deploy Let's Encrypt certificates to enable HTTPS on your website. EFF even helped develop Let’s Encrypt which has in turn enabled free and easy encryption across the web!
Cover Your Tracks: This successor to EFF’s Panopticlick demonstrates how well your browser and add-ons protect you from tracking and fingerprinting.
HTTPS Everywhere: For over a decade, EFF has successfully advocated for secure certificate adoption. HTTPS Everywhere automatically connects users to the encrypted version of many major sites.
Privacy Badger: This popular browser add-on stops online trackers from secretly following where you go and what pages you look at on the web.

The world relies on the internet to stay connected and informed more than ever before, and that gives you a pivotal opportunity to stand up for technology users everywhere. Your support for EFF ensures that we always have a vocal advocate wherever tech and civil liberties meet.

UPDATE:

Thanks to support from internet users and technology creators like you, EFF has kept up the momentum with progress on numerous issues!

Fiber Broadband & Open Web: EFF helped California residents and lawmakers pass one of the largest state investments in public fiber broadband in U.S. history last year. Now we’re fighting major ISPs’ efforts to undermine and derail a future-proof internet, including the AT&T-sponsored legislation AB 2749.

Online Intermediaries: EFF launched a series about digital rights issues and online intermediaries—the third parties including internet service providers (ISPs), search engines, and social media platforms that allow you to communicate online. We’ve analyzed policy proposals that could ultimately harm freedom of expression and other rights for internet users around the world.

Public.Resource.Org Victory: Supported by EFF, the nonprofit scored a win for fair use and vindicated its ability to publicly post important laws online. We must be able to find, read, and comment on the law free of registration requirements, fees, and technical roadblocks.

Social Media & Free Speech: EFF urged the U.S. Supreme Court to halt enforcement of Texas’ constitutionally questionable social media law, which allows the state to dictate what speech platforms must publish. Such legislation may lead to more, not less, censorship of user expression as platforms face a storm of lawsuits. EFF is monitoring numerous laws and lawsuits attempting to force certain types of speech on internet platforms.

Ukraine, Russia, and the Internet: From the start of the invasion, we’ve seen short-sighted calls for technical intervention that range from infrastructural interference to problematic hacktivism. The conflict has also further exposed gaps in social media moderation that can cause real world harm. We must protect the web’s ability to serve as a lifeline for civilians’ communications and resistance, especially in times of turmoil.

UN Cybercrime Treaty: The United Nations is considering a transformational cybercrime treaty that would have broad implications for international privacy, security, and human rights. We’re fighting for acceptable safeguards alongside a coalition of over 100 international civil society groups.

YFIStats.com (site updated today, please clear cache for latest version) is a webapp that displays multiple interactive dashboards that track various KPIs (key performance indicators) for the yEarn ecosystem. It is important to track KPIs so we can set goals for protocol growth and adjust our approach on the fly if the data shows a need.

I've been a solopreneur in the ecommerce space for almost 10 years, and I have plenty of experience in both selecting meaningful KPIs to monitor as well as developing cloud solutions to handle the entire process from raw data to pretty pictures. Now I wish to build for the DeFi space.

My dashboards aren't as ""clean"" as some of the web3 dashboards that people have been creating but the interactivity of the reports and the ability to visualize the data in an infinite number of ways using traditional Business Intelligence tools (I cover this expense) more than makes up for it. 

YFIStats aims to showcase data that is useful for both potential protocol customers (hopefully converting them to users of the protocol) and protocol governors. Currently, the entire site is public facing but I seek to create a private section for the yEarn governors so that we can make informed business decisions for the protocol, based on solid data. This will help the protocol to grow which will help attract more eyeballs to the space, further catalyzing growth in other areas of DeFi.

1728,argantreeproject-operation-argan-rescue,"Tl;dr

- We're a group of researchers with a goal of preserving a dying endemic species of trees called Argan Trees.

- Our works has two sides to it: Breeding and transplantation.

- For now we're working on a project called ""Operation Argan Rescue 202"" aimed at transplanting 202 Argan trees by the end of February.

- We need help financing our project and paying for our major expense (Equipment), we already have 35% of the sum we need, and we set the rest as a goal for this grant 7150$.


Introduction

We are a non-profit organization made mainly of researchers in the field of Botany. Our main concern are native and endemic species to our region, in particular Argan trees, for which we hold a special love and interest.

Our guiding principle is that these rare plants threatened by extinction must be protected and preserved so that our children as well as our grand grand children may have the same chance to benefit from the wide range of uses these ""tough"" amazing trees grant us.

We hope that people share with us the same concerns and help us to do our best in order to sustain these resources.

Why the Argan Tree?

Argan tree plays a crucial role in the rural and urban economy of Morocco. Not only is the tree used in traditional medicine but its fruits contain almonds used to prepare an edible oil, its leaves are utilized to feed cattle, and its wood is used as fuel. In addition the tree is particularly well-adapted to arid lands and could hence be used to limit the desert progression that is threatening subtropical African countries.

Past projects:

""Operation Argan Breeding 1K"" and ""Operation Argan Rescue 101"" have been both two successful experiences for us. 

- ""Operation Argan Breeding 1K"" had a goal of breeding and securing a controlled environment for Argan trees along with doing various analyses on different samples for research purposes done by students and researches from different universities.

- ""Operation Argan Rescue 101"" set as a goal the transplantation of 101 Argan trees to an area where the local populace can benefit from it for their various needs. These Argan trees were located in a privately owned land meant for eventual cement extraction, which meant absolute destruction for the plants on that land. Our mission had an urgency to it, as the company owning the land could only delay its usage of the land for a narrow period of time, forcing us to take action quickly in order to move the Argan trees located in the concerned area to a land where they can be safe and can be of benefit to nature and people.

Visit our Website here https://sites.google.com/view/argantreeproject/news to learn more.

Current project:

""Operation Argan Rescue 101"" was only a part of a series of operations mainly concerned of transplanting Argan trees which are threatened by destruction. As the land targeted in ""Operation Argan Rescue 101"" has way more than 101 Argan trees in it, subsequent operations will follow aimed particularly at moving and transplanting all Argan trees in that area.

Our current project is ""Operation Argan Rescue 202"". This time we're aiming higher for a number of 202 Argan trees moved and transplanted by the end of February. This project concerns an adjacent area to the one we worked on in the previous transplantation project, the area still holds more Argan trees, but we like to set feasible goals and work step by step.

Grant's purpose:

We would like to gather enough funds to achieve our goals for the current project. As the two projects before it, our main constraint is budget, luckily we always find a number of volontueers (usually students) who are willing to contribute to the differents parts of the project.

As for our expenses, the major part goes to renting equipment.
The moving and transplantation process will take 10 days from start to finish, In those 10 days 3 pieces of heavy machinery will be needed, we detail a list of these machines here:

JCB Tractor (with a cost of 250$ a day)
Poclain machine (with a cost of 350$ a day)
Truck for transporting (with a cost of 400$ a day)

As for maintenance a water tank truck will be needed (with a cost of 50$ a day) two days a month for a period of 10 months.

Total = 11.000$.

We managed to gather as contribution 35% of our goal, and we turn now to Gitcoin to find the rest.

We appreciate any and all contributions to our cause. Thank you.

2063,green-nft-grant,"Bounty For More Ecologically Friendly NFTs

Problem: Making a living as an artist is historically extremely challenging. For many artists and their families, the digital art economy built around NFTs has saved them financially, particularly during COVID with its uncertain economy and poor job market. However, minting NFTs has been found to be energy inefficient and damaging to the environment. This has created a division and friction among creatives. 

Solution: Wanting to see this friction redirected towards something more productive, we propose a bounty system to reward people for trying to improve the energy efficiency of the NFT economy. 

Awareness Bounty: Unfortunately, most artists and collectors are not aware of the many options for minting NFTs and their associated ecological impact. This first bounty will be awarded to a body of research that outlines a wide variety of current projects/solutions and explains how they reduce energy consumption of NFTs. The hope is that by having a consolidated resource with clear information on the advantages of supporting these options, we can immediately reduce the impact of NFTs on the environment without waiting for longer-term solutions. 

Solutions Bounty: As exciting as the blockchain is, we are mostly encouraged by the community of bright, young creatives that have formed around it. Yes, there are many efforts in progress to improve efficiency, but most of these are company/platform driven. We believe great ideas can come from anywhere and hope that an independent bounty for the development of more efficient NFTs will drive some out-of-the-box thinking to complement existing approaches. This bounty is targeted at developers creating open source solutions. Preference will be given to solutions that improve existing markets, as popularizing a new chain/technology from scratch is beyond the scope and capabilities of this bounty program. 

Judging: Portions of the bounty will be awarded to teams and individual contributors based on the discretion of a panel of judges who will be selected based on their contributions and good standing within the NFT community.

Closing: Above all, we have faith in the ingenuity and creativity of the CryptoArt/NFT community and want to see it continue to flourish. Hopefully this initiative is just the first of many as we continue to explore new ways to take ownership over the future of our creative economy in a way that is increasingly ecologically friendly and one that we can be proud of.",https://www.artnome.com/greennfts,-1,-1,0,-1,-1,https://github.com/artnome,1

The game is being built in Unity, and coded with C#. For the ethereum part of the game, i am using Nethereum.

The game will be in 3d, and the genre is fantasy i guess. It involves swords and magic spells!

The core concept is that every little item will be an NFT, but they will be bind on equip. Meaning if you equip an item, it will no longer be tradeable. Making good items scarce.

Players will be divided into three different factions, that compete for world resources and political power.
Another core concept is the idea of in game politics, using a governance token that is distributed to players according to their in game activity(Exactly how has not been decided yet). 
By voting, players can decide about in game events, what way the game development will take, when a certain season will end. The possibilities are endless. 
Keeping and holding certain areas in game would make your faction recieve more tokens than the other factions, incentivising PvP and activity.

I have been working on this project pretty much full time the last 5 months, due to corona.

2130,ethereum-studymaster,"Platform History

The Ethereum Studymaster Platform was created by the ETHStaker Community as a means to help newcomers understand Ethereum 2.0 Serenity. It was a 10-week course where each week required a 'student' to read an article, then pass a quiz based on that article with a 70% or above. 

If you completed all 10 weeks and passed all of your quizzes you received an exclusive Ethereum Studymaster POAP. The Ethereum Studymaster Platform has shown incredible growth and is in need of additional resources to help it mature to the next level. 

The Ethereum Studymaster Platform is driven by student curiosity, and fueled by POAP. For each course completed you will be able to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you not only finished a course but are also competent on the subject matter with your exclusive POAP.


What Exactly Is The Ethereum Studymaster?
The Ethereum Studymaster Platform is designed to be a platform for anyone looking to learn about Ethereum or anything within the overall Ethereum ecosystem by providing open courses for anyone to access and learn from. Courses will eventually range from an in-depth technical breakdown of the Ethereum consensus mechanism to explaining how to set up your own wallet, to minting NFTs. Students who pass courses and obtain an official Ethereum Studymaster POAP will be eligible to vote for what the next courses will be and have a voice in how the platform will grow/mature. 


What's Next?
The Ethereum Studymaster Platform has been designed and developed by a single person (unvetica.eth of the ETHStaker Community), and needs additional resources to help take the platform to the next level.

With successful funding, there will be additional courses created for newcomers to continue learning. To date, there is only 1 course available. But with additional funding, the Ethereum Studymaster Platform can afford to create additional courses like: 

How to build an Ethereum 2.0 Validator from scratch
The ETH1/ETH2 Merge: An In-depth breakdown
What are NFTs, and how to make your own
What are POAPs and how to create/distribute your own
Introduction to DeFi
How to set up an Ethereum Wallet + Keep it safe

These are just a few examples of the courses we're hoping to develop. Additionally, the Ethereum Studymaster Platform will get much-needed UI/UX updates for students to allow for a more intuitive learning experience. Adding features to save study materials to review later, connect with fellow students to form online study groups, and a dedicated place to store and showcase your POAPs from completed courses. 

Furthermore, with additional funding, the Ethereum Studymaster Platform will be developed so that anyone interested in creating their own courses will be able to publish them. This means if a small business wanted to host their corporate on-boarding materials for employees they can create a course on Ethereum Studymaster, the possibilities are endless.

1995,ralie-network-connecting-through-blockchain,"Our vision is to help mainstream users, changing how they see cryptocurrency: from a speculative investment into a tool to pay for services and content. With that in mind, we decided to launch a platform where people could use their crypto-assets to buy on-demand content and come together to build great new services and solutions. A platform where paying with crypto is HIGHLY REWARDED. Ralie Network first goals are to democratize knowledge and give everyone access to services in a decentralized, censorship-resistant, and permissionless environment on the Ethereum Network. Ralie Network flagships are called Ralie Learn and Ralie Work.

Ralie Learn is a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform where users can buy video-classes on demand.
Ralie Work is a Freelancer Platform where users can use their crypto-assets to hire and attract talents.




The figure ""Ralie Network explained"" is the best way to show the whole system in a simple but objective manner. Starting from the bottom, both platforms, Ralie Learn and Ralie Work are connected to a database, parsing the input data and routing it to its respective Smart Contract that interacts with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Solutions in Layer 2, such as escrow and payment channels, help handle the interactions between clients and customers and ease the number of transactions sent to the EVM.

The DeFi explosion introduced a wide range of new decentralized tools and solutions, but the most empowering to the whole community was the Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO). 

We also believe that it is possible to create a vehicle to shift the power over the revenue from a few share-holders to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, democratize profits, and set new standards for new blockchain technologies. This is why Ralie Network is committed to creating a community-driven platform where anyone participating in the Governance Protocol has the Right to vote and be entitled to a share of all recurring fees generated with every transaction made through the platform.

Governance Protocol

Starting from the BETA launch of Ralie Learn, the first platform to be launched by Ralie Network. RIE Token HODLers will have the option to stake their tokens through the Governance Protocol. 

In the DAO section of Ralie official website (https://ralie.io/), the option to Stake in the Governance Protocol will be available. Each RIE Token staked will grant the staking address a stRIE token, representing the position of that address in the Governance Protocol. 


Users participating in the Governance Protocol are instantly eligible to participate in the DAO incentive program. DAO members have several benefits. Some of them are listed below:

RIE Token rewards distributed on a weekly basis. These rewards are determined by the fraction of the DAO member position compared to the total number of RIE tokens Staked;

Voting power on the community-driven proposals. Voting power on Ralie Team proposals. Voting power over the DAO controlled dynamic token burn speed;

Entitled to a percentage of all transaction fees recurring from every payment settled on the platform with cryptocurrency, paid out in RIE tokens. The calculation of how these fees are split between DAO members, the RIE treasury, and the percentage burned is a bit more complex and will have a dedicated section to its explanation.

It’s a podcast-style research platform composed of interviews with DAO researchers, developers and enthusiasts. The interviews always keep a casual tone.

In total, the show has delivered 28 interviews with the makers of the DAO world. As well as setting up the DAOline, a place for DAO enthusiasts to distributively connect and build community bonds across projects.

So far, DAOcast has been running mostly as a volunteering project. There has been only a one-off monetizing experiment, with a proposal to Genesis DAO. With that, the show has created and delivered ""DAO to Earth"", a series of interviews with Genesis members investigating what it means to be part of a decentralized organization.

Therefore, the funds raised through this grant will be used to keep the show running, allowing for a greater frequency of interviews, as well as R&D for the deployment of the DAOcast DAO. The dream is to have such a DAO functioning as an umbrella for many different kinds of podcasts.

3384,an-alternative-to-account-abstraction-with-secure,"Founded in 2018, Crypteriat is focused on making the world a better place by developing technologies around Blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Our mission is to provide high quality open source projects enabling DApp composition leveraging a new fog computing infrastructure. This agent is part of our core foundation in creating Compose DAO, an organisation introducing new standards in the DeFi space. More information can be found on our GitLab page here.

The Problem
Internet users, today, face a number of cybersecurity issues. One major problem has been the centralization of usernames and passwords. Mistrust and attacks on the internet services holding this data can make the user's information very vulnerable. The current approach also does not support a paradigm for storing or deploying assets into DeFi protocols and then ejecting and monitoring performance. Specifically, it’s currently not possible within the EVM to have smart contracts be the top-level account that starts transaction execution and pays fees. We aim to provide a three level asset management solution similar to checking, savings, and long term capital management built with an alternative solution to account abstraction.

The Solution
Zero knowledge like technologies such as Secure Remote Password (SRP) would improve internet security and leverage the Ethereum Name System (ENS) with agents acting on behalf of end-users. We are developing a system of devices that will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to interact with these services on the user's behalf. This simply enables the user to:

Connect to services by only providing an account name (or e.g. Ethereum Name Service mnemonic)
Prove to the verifier (service) they own the account without revealing the password 
Set custom authentication policies for each service
Use ephemeral QR code or link to authenticate services

The SRP agent can then provide a foundation for users to manage their hot, cold & leverage ""delegated"" agents to delegate and deploy capital into the DeFi ecosystem. Along with our Compose Virtual Machine, the agent’s foundation provides a solution to the problem of account abstraction where a transaction can only execute from an externally owned account. By generating a new set of standards, this offers an alternative that does not require re-architecting the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This approach would be analogous to creating a management system similar to checking, savings, asset management account, and vault storage. Assets conforming with the new Compose DAO DeFi standards, otherwise known as ERC1155+, are compose-able payment manageable. We call this a ""Delegated Wallet.""






Deliverables
Secure Remote Password (SRP) Agent: Software running on NixOS to act as an authentication agent which runs continuously.
A Mobile Progressive Web App (PWA) which can act as an Ephemeral Link Signer. This app will allow individuals to sign authentication requests per the Internet service policy.
A Test website to act as a verifier and policy provider to the SRP agent. The site will demonstrate basic authentication and re-authentication policies.






09-June-2022 Progress Report:

We have been making progress on this project as part of a larger effort with Compose DAO. We've turned our Discord server into a Web 3 service using SRP via a custom Discord bot that we have written. The demo linked on this page demonstrates the transition into Web 3 authentication mechanisms that will ultimately obsolesce OAuth and Turing test Web 2 processes. In addition, this Gitcoin deliverable demonstrates an initial Composed DApp for the DAO project. In effect, by using the Discord verification as a ""test Website"" via the bot will allow Gitcoin users to verify themselves into the Compose DAO Discord server to on-board into Web 3. Since our last progress report in April 2022 we have:

Built a Discord bot capable of using the SRP authentication process to verify users into our server. Note this bot does not provide authentication into Discord itself. It only does verification for our Gitcoin contributors and new members to access our DAO channels. 
Created a Deno-based back-end which accepts and uses tRPC to act as a proxy and ephemeral DApp UI generator. This code allows the bot to use the Discord verification process and associate a re-usable nym to instantiate the DApp front-end and back-end. There is some original work here in integrating tRPC with Deno and AWS.
Implemented custom slash commands for our Discord server with the goal to automate the contribution process as much as possible so anyone can easily contribute.
Put together this demo, demonstrating the above.

Our next goal is to begin the development of xDApps (cross chain compatible DApps) built with our CVM: Compose Virtual Machine. Ultimately this will allow users to deploy their capital into the DeFi ecosystem to generate yield and manage their funds on multiple chains. To achieve this we are hoping to bridge the Lightning Bitcoin Network and Ethereum Virtual Machine ecosystems together. 

If you have interest in contributing to the project or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us on our Discord or Twitter. Thank you so much for all of your contributions and advice over the past few months.

Not like other Layer 2 projects focusing on solving the payment issues, the grant will be used to do the public good research and development on how the governance protocol for DAOs can leverage Layer 2 to better govern their communities. And the research focus for this stage is the communication mechanism between Layer 1 and Layer 2.

The current governance protocols for DAOs on Layer 1 have many limitations, like the low scalability, low efficiency, high cost and no privacy. And these limitations have restricted DAO's governance protocol to only one simple scenario, which is voting. While for the complex collaborations conducted in the community all the time, the current governance protocols are powerless. Metis Protocol hopes to integrates the governance mechanism (Layer 1) and collaboration framework (Layer 2) to upgrade and empower DAOs to activate, lead and govern the community members' participation in the progress of the project.

462,savedai,"Overview
saveDAI is an easy way to open an insured, high-interest savings account, full stop.

saveDAI is the first self-insured asset (that we know of). It generates interest (via Compound) and is also protected from financial, governance, and bug/hacking risk (via Opyn).

saveDAI is an ERC20 token that, when minted, takes in DAI and converts it to an equal amount of cDAI (interest-generating DAI from Compound) and ocDAI (tokenized cDAI protective puts from the Opyn protocol).

saveDAI is also a user interface for minting the saveDAI token and managing the insurance component. Savers (our version of users) can deposit DAI into saveDAI, withdraw from their saveDAI account, and -- in the case of an adverse financial event, hack, or bug -- submit an insurance claim to receive ETH equivalent to the amount of their original DAI deposit.

BlockScout: Blockchain Explorer for Inspecting and Analyzing EVM blockchains

Overview

BlockScout is an invaluable open-source tool for exploring, confirming, and inspecting transactions on any EVM blockchain. It can be modified to suit a project's needs, and provides much needed transparency and redundancy within the blockchain ecosystem. 

Blockscout is already the open-source block explorer of choice for many large blockchain projects including Gnosis Chain, Ethereum Classic, Celo, and many others. Blockscout has been used by the kiln test network in supporting the merge, and recently a mainnet Ethereum instance was reintroduced!

BlockScout is an expensive project to maintain. Hosting costs, data storage, custom enhancements, and continuous feature developments create a large overhead each month. We believe a transparent, full-featured explorer is a necessary resource for the entire ecosystem, including L1s and L2s, and Blockscout will continue to support transactional transparency following the merge.

Just as it is important to have diversity in Ethereum client implementations, it is important to support diversity in other vital infrastructure to ensure decentralization, checks-and-balances, and fallback options. Blockscout provides this resource and is relatively easy to deploy for projects who need a primary block explorer for testnet and mainnet purposes, as well as projects requiring a secondary instance.

Upcoming improvements

The team is working to increase the usefulness of the base instance including new My Account features, NFT view enhancements, a revamped UI, and a modular codebase which can support many more features in the future. We're also looking to streamline deployment processes for new projects.

Thanks to previous grants we've been able to implement many items including EIP-1559 support, multi-file smart contract verification, improved data sorting and data storage optimizations. We are excited to continue improving this open-source explorer for the community and certainly appreciate your support to help with these efforts. If you have a feature enhancement you'd like to see, please let us know. As an open-source project we are open to community contributions on Github. Thank you!

Democracy is about fair and equal treatment of everyone in a country. But it becomes unrealistic to achieve when political parties have their conflict of interest, and leaders don’t have the expertise to make evidence-based policies and neither have the skill and manpower for solving problems that surround our society and ecosystem. The new fair democracy provides an elegant way of governance that separates the representative responsibility according to their specialization and can grow into any complexity. The governance is divided into various departments, and each department is supervised by representatives with expertise in the field. Voters need to have enough knowledge about the departments and their problems, in order to vote for the selecting representatives of a department. The selection process of representatives is “difficult in and easy out”, which allows only utilitarian actors to hold the responsibility, weeding out frivolous ones.

1) Fair (treating people equally without favoritism or discrimination) and equal opportunity to succeed for each and everyone.
2)Decentralized Democracy, No authoritarian regime or no anarchical regime (leaderlessness or ignorant leaders lacking knowledge or good judgment) and no concentration of power, because the ability to approve policy is limited only to the concerned department who have the required expertise to make a decision.
3) Evidence-based democracy, Only evidence based policies are allowed, and representatives need to be experts in the field and each statement they make in the policy has to be backed by evidence and sound reasoning.
4) No catch22 paradox, that is people have true freedom to remove their representatives easily without the involvement of any vested interest or party politics.
5)Collaborative democracy, Collaborative problem solving, not by competition.
As all representatives have almost an equal chance of getting remove if the behave frivolously (not having any serious purpose or value), they have to collaborate in order to solve a problem, not compete for each other.
7) Infinitely Stable Democracy, Indefinitely stable government, voting will continue in short intervals like 6 months, but the government will remain stable infinitely.
8) No nepotism (the practice among those with power or influence of favoring relatives or friends, especially by giving them jobs), frivolous one just can’t stay.
9) No conflict of interest democracy, No in-group or out-group bias, representatives can take their individual stand, without considering the profit and loss of their alliance and opponent. Democracy design where conflict of interest is not plausible. Not a don’t be evil design, but a can’t be evil design.
As there are no opponent parties with their self-interested goals, and representatives are experts in their respective fields, consensus to reach a decision will be more objective (not influenced by personal feelings or opinions; considering only facts) and justifiable.

10) Evolutionary democracy, that gets adapted and refined with an increase in efficiency and productivity of representatives with each election every 6 months, as bad candidates are removed by voters.
11) Blockchain democracy, without any middleman or brokers such as politicians (MPs, MLAs, PM, CM) and bureaucrats, who delay the implementation. People will transact directly with their service provider departments.
12) Mega participation democracy, with a massive number of expert representatives per department, who can implement policies collaboratively within a limited extent of time as it makes a decent ratio between population versus a department. Representatives will also assign tasks to voters, common citizens, and students to quickly get the job done by volunteering.
13) Mobile and global democracy, where boundaries between countries become obscure with time, the expertise of representatives matter, not the origin.
14) Inclusive democracy, people are not discriminated because of origin, color, gender, sexual orientation, type of job, culture, age, legacy, ethnicity, generation, genetic characteristics and disability.

The Justice Committee is a grassroots organization dedicated to building a movement to end police violence and systemic racism in NYC. The heart of our work is organizing and uplifting the leadership of families who have lost loved ones to the police and survivors of police violence. We empower New Yorkers to fight for police accountability and transparency and build true community safety through policy campaigns, trainings, public education, CopWatch, and by developing safety practices and mechanisms that minimize reliance on law enforcement.

Our Vision
As our name suggests, the long-term vision of the Justice Committee is a world in which the voices and needs of all become the imperative, a world not governed by the most ""powerful"" and materially wealthy. We seek to contribute to a coordinated global movement that will attain this world by building a New York City in which people are not victimized by systemic racism and other forms of oppression and do not suffer or fear killings and abuse at the hands of the NYPD and other forms of law enforcement. The work of the Justice Committee will be complete when NYC’s marginalized communities have the power and mechanisms to hold the authorities accountable, are empowered to determine by what principles and methods the city is managed and kept safe, and have built meaningful ties to others communities organizing for justice throughout the United States and the world.

865,extremeinsureme-dao-cover-for-living-a-life-less-,"A fully decentralised front end & back end 'cover' to replace traditional insurance using DIFI wallet and bonding curves.

No Exclusion Cover for Extreme Sports & Adventure Travel Lifestyles
The ExtremeDAO covers you to participate freely in any of the activities you love.
No fine print, or add-ons; any sport, any location, any altitude, it's all included.
With the ExtremeDAO, everything is transparent. There is a flat fee of 20% for fiat<>crypto wallet support and to establish the infrastructure.
If you leave, you get back anything you put in less the fee.
By working together the community aims to provide cover up to $25,000USD.

Application for GitCoin
The aim is to create a simple to use fully decentralised cover that offers a $25,000 USD payout upon accidental death (subject to funds in the DAO). This amount is sufficient to return the body to a family, cover funeral costs and any travel required from any location in the world.
The efficiency brought by cloud technology, automation and blockchain results in lesser premiums as smart contracts don’t require the risk to be transferred. The current model includes a broker, insurance provider, the reinsurance provider. Ultimately the risk owner is far removed from the actual risk, what if your cover was fully automated, completely transparent and community managed with local support?
For $25USD a month payable in ETH (or Fiat via an exchange) and we’ll hold the value of the fund in an escrow account stored in a smart contract. Effectively users retain their own funds in the pool, less a 20% fee paid to ExtremeInsureMeDAO which covers the cost of operations and technology R&D.
Non crypto users will be enabled to purchase the cover via a monthly payment on their credit card, the community will provide support for the use of metamask to on-board them to the DAO.
In the case of a claim event, the amount is paid to the claimant based on a % of that customer's tokens to their nominated beneficiaries.
At any time the user can sell their tokens and effectively cash out the policy, less 20% which is to cover R&D to build the stack.
The claims process will be transparent and managed via a DAO.
The help we need now is to integrate the off the shelf subscription platform with a crypto payment API and the MetaMask AP and Alchemy. We need $2,500USD for each integration as we’re using an off the shelf open ERP called Odoo for the beta which we’re hosting on our own servers, We aim to raise $10,000 to create a small fund for a developer to leverage the API to mostly automate the service. The minimum we need to raise to have a meaningful impact is $2,500USD.
CreditCard to Crypto API
MetaMask Wallet API
AlchemyDAO Claims Process
EtherScan API integration into Accounting Module
We have found a potential developer and are working on the architure to ensure we can secure the movement for crypto assets.
If you like the concept and want to contribute a significant amount we would build a difi wallet. At this stage we are use low cost building blocks to test and validate. We have approx 50 people ready to join the DAO but have had this delayed due to high GAS fees.

Background
ExtremeInsureMe was first conceived in 2013 when Jesse was unable to find life cover that would provide him with insurance that would take care of his family if something went wrong when he was racing his sports car. Matthew travelled to Mexico to go kitesurfing in Los Barriles, in 2018 he rode a Mountain bike over the Alps from Tegernsee in German through Austria to Lake Garda in Italy and in 2019 he learnt to Freedive in Timor Leste.
We know it is easier to find exclusions for insurance then inclusions, every time we did something fun it wasn’t covered and this causes us concern as fathers. We decided to use crypto assets as a way to fully decentralise the back end and front end for a new way to manage risk when you live your fullest life. 
Here we come to take on the big boys who don’t trust you when you make a claim and haven’t thought accurately about the real support that is needed, not just financial payment after the fact.
The next 12 months are important for us to validate the idea, build the initial fund with friends and family so we can expand this offer to others globally.

The problem
The ExtremeDAO is designed for people who take the road less travelled. You love the adrenaline kick of adventures but don’t want to leave your family with a burden if the worst case happens.
To access insurance cover for these types of risk, multiple add ons are required for special packages which rack up high costs for consumers. The whole process of finding the appropriate cover is difficult and rarely does it meet all of your needs, athletes and weekend warriors often will have areas where they don’t have a cover and choose not to extend this because it only is required for 5 hours during their trip.
We believe our initial DAO offer will appeal to backpackers and fully independent travellers and adventure athletes that are looking for long-stay travel insurance, though due to ease of use and segment size we expect early adopters to be in the single trip category, people are searching for sports or travel health travel cover POSTCovid.
We're not trying to build a company, we are creating a community that can support each other in times of need. Getting a payout after the fact is out of date, payments should be global and realtime and what you really need is local support. We want to flip insurance on its head by making cover fully transparent and building resilience into a community.
If we get this architecture right the model can be opened for supporting the un-insured.

3936,longevity-wiki,"The need:
There is a need for accessible longevity science content. Currently, readers are limited to two primary choices: reading scientific papers, or blogs such as Lifespan.io or FightAging.org. While the former typically requires a high degree of scientific literacy, the latter is limited in trustworthiness due to the inherent conflict of interest being advocacy organizations in the space. What is lacking from the longevity information ecosystem is a trustworthy, decentralized, and scientifically credible education platform that is accessible to a broader audience. 

The solution: 
Longevity Wiki is the world’s first open-access longevity education platform. Longevity Wiki aims to combine comprehensive, high-quality articles that are scientifically rigorous and accessible to a broad audience. The decentralized, wiki-style technology allows multiple contributors to assist in the creation of an evolving source of truth in the longevity space.

The non-for-profit structure of the organization allows transparent and accurate overviews of the state of the art of longevity science without relying upon sponsorship from specific corporations in the space. This endows the Wiki with a level of impartiality that is currently lacking in the existing information ecology. 

The mission of the organization is to create valuable research summaries that propel basic research and biotechnological development in the longevity space. We see this occurring in two ways: 
(i) Educating lay (non-scientific) audiences to become familiar with longevity science to promote societal awareness and funding opportunities
(ii) Providing a centralized and curated hub for consolidating knowledge gathered from evolving scientific developments in this space.

The plan is to translate content into multiple languages, facilitated by the multilingual feature on MediaWiki. Our vision is to allow access to longevity science to hundreds of millions of readers to whom longevity science content is less accessible due to language barriers, in China, Russia, and elsewhere. 

Longevity Wiki is working closely with the moderators of the /r/longevity subreddit, including team member Benjamin Wu, for a strategic launch later this year. Our vision is to synergize with the longevity subreddit to produce up-to-date content that represents the current state of the art at any given time. 

How the Wiki started: 
Following the success of Jack Harley’s popular LessWrong article, Anti-Aging: State of the Art, Jack teamed up with experienced software engineer Bogdan Dziewierz to create a Wiki for longevity science education. 

The current state of the Wiki:
Since then, the core team has expanded to six, including successful startup founder Max Schulz. An additional 20+ volunteers are assisting with web development and content creation. The core and peripheral teams are preparing the Wiki for public launch on December 15th 2021.

Funding requirements
We are seeking funding opportunities to expedite the growth and value proposition of the wiki through financing the following paid roles:
Lead editors and Community managers to streamline the content creation pipeline. 
Engineers to maintain the wiki platform and work on the planned tools.  

Additionally, we require constant funding to maintain our IT infrastructure.

We believe these high-leverage paid roles will allow Longevity Wiki to gain sufficient traction to reach a critical mass of contributors and ultimately have a real impact on the longevity space.

Eth-ter-I-Die produces instructions for your non-technical beneficiary to convert your Ethereum Tokens, from a variety of different DApps, to Ether and transfer that Ether to your beneficiaries local currency. Once you have completed filling out the selection of DApps and services you use. A .txt file is generated that allows you to edit, print and then hand write the private details required for your beneficiaries to access your address/ wallets. This document should be kept as safe as your seed phrase as it is a literal ""how to guide"" on accessing all of your Ethereum based assets. This is a free service for the community to use.

I couldn't find anything that would do this for my own needs so I created it and thought it may be useful for other folk too. It seems to be a topic that people don't really talk about it.

Roadmap

Here are some planned feature to Eth-ter-I-Die for the short and long term. I am constantly developing and adding new guides as and when i get the time and chipping away at the longer term goals.

Short Term
		
Add more DApp and Service instructions!
Improve consistency, grammar and clarification of existing instructions

Long Term
Make decentralised (currently hosted on GitHub Pages...)
Add multi- Language Support
Add ""Create Dapp Instructions submission"" form
Add ""Connect Wallet"" feature to scrape all current asset info from your address and produce a document accordingly

Longer Term 
Research and develop optimal and dynamic solution for beneficiaries to be able to access your Ethereum based assets. 
The current Eth-ter-I-Die method is not dynamic, for example if you find a new DApp/ Service you invest in after you create the Eth-ter-I-Die document and then pass away those funds would be lost. An ideal solution would be able to catch that. I have ideas but these need to be developed.

Nifty Pride 2021 was a huge success, raising over $15k USD for LGBTQ+ focused charities, hosting a month-long exhibition spread across nearly a dozen galleries in Cryptovoxels and DCL, as well as having several artists from the Nifty Pride community featured in XO Crypto, an IRL gallery exhibition held at the NYC Blockchain Center in downtown Manhattan. 
We've joined forces with Artsy DeFi to internalize their project as a ""branch"" of NFThub, and did the same with Club 90nine. (in doing so the team now includes a very talented solidity developer, and the club 90nine members have joined the dao) 
We partnered with Uniqly to launch our phygital merchandise brand, Nonfungible Fashion 
Our partnership with Polycat mean we'll soon be offering a yield farm on the oldest and most reilient yield farming platform on Polygon
We've been focused largely on an NFT project release for the past month or two, as our entry to the NFT Vision hackathon, for which we were community/media partners, with the launch planned for the 28th of this month. More info can be found at https://polygoonz.finance
Another addition to the team, and one that we feel will be incredibly beneficial Iis a professional brand manager who also has experience as a content marketing strategist and is very confident on the long term vision/goals of NFThub. 
We'll be holding presentations at Polycon, as well as at Dygycon, both happening later in September
We've been nominated for Hacker Noon's ""Startup of the Year"" awards
We're planning to hold an NFT auction as a method of fundraising to espedite the process of getting off of the runway; the NFTs will be producced via charged particles, allowing us to ""charge"" with our token under a timelock, potentially making them much more valuable in the future, while also allowing us to accomplish some more of the required development along with performing a substantial buyback and burn

We've been in discussions with an extensive network throughout the NFT space about collaboratrions, strategic partners, etc. and feel as tho NFThub will become the go-to resource for discovering, validating and learning all things NFT. We've joined the Panvala League based on shared community-first values; the as well as the Blockchain Game Alliance to support the push for stream adoption. 

We hope to see you on the platform soon, and appreciate your time and support!!!

Update - Q1 2022

  NFThub has been relatively quiet through most of Q4 '21, but not because there's any less intention of building something beneficial to the NFT space. Currently, NFThub is managed by a very small team, which more often than not is a single person wearing all of the hats, and the parabolic growth of the NFT industry has made it a much more arduous task than it once was.  When the project was conceptualized in the spring of 2020, the goal of aggregating news, projects, events and education surrounding NFTs was reasonable to think of as possible/

Update: Q2 2022

NFThub will be migrating in a sense. Due to the growing number of projects/DAOs etc. that our very small team is involved with; we thought it best to establish an 'umbrella brand' under which all of these projects can be nested. This essentially will serve to convert the DAOs for NFThub, Nifty Pride, Club 90nine, and other relevant projects to become subDAOs; each with their own independent governance, but as well each gaining the benefit of brand awareness, unified discussions, multi-chain tokenomics, and additional benefits from being a part of the DappGoose Labs ecosystem.

Another important update is that we've been recruiting. Our team will soon be onboarding about a half-dozen members; many of whom are relatively new to the NFT/crypto ecosystems, but have experience in some much-needed areas for the continuation and growth of NFThub; such as marketing, product management, and software development,

3135,invulnerable-creators-defi-eth-technical-tutorial,"Invulnerable Creators is a YouTube channel that focuses on showcasing creators building with tech in addition to technical tutorials. 

Did you know? 

""Finding enough qualified computer science teachers is also an issue in secondary education. Only 36 teachers graduated from universities with computer science degrees in 2017, compared with 11,157 math teachers and 11,905 science teachers, according to the nonprofit Code.org. In 2016, 75 teachers graduated from universities equipped to teach the subject, the organization reports.""

> Link to CS Teacher shortages here 


The reason this channel started, was not to have an extremely crypto niche name and in addition to having more regular tech content. Especially when people are interested in tech, but need enough mere-exposures to crypto content mixed in with regular tech and creator content. 

Back to the issue above about the lack of software developers with bachelors or masters willing to expertly run a class room and code for $40,000 a year. Plus, many online tech educators have the latest software knowledge and do work with major companies regularly and freelance while bringing that knowledge to their students. Plus, teachers are really meant to be more monitors. In the 1800s, students governed themselves and the best became monitors. Then the monitors if they were really that great got recruited out for higher educational and career opportunities. Which already sounds like a top tier internet community. 

> Link to 1800s American Classrooms here

The highest vision for this channel to grow is to have a community website.

The worst part of this computer science teacher shortage is most people I've talked to do not know this is a problem. I've reached out to teachers at schools and they refuse to talk about their programs. I think they're ashamed and shut down emotionally. So, it's another wall I hit on that front. If Wisconsin regulators knew how bad the CS teacher shortage was, I'm not sure they would have done a regulation to completely hinder software developer opportunities. Wisconsin has an issue retaining tech talent, so they banned online bootcamps (I'm assuming ones ran out of state). All of the top online coding bootcamps are based out of state. So if you want to try to become the best in software development, you're forced to leave the state or learn the tech stack local to the area. I learned this only when I was denied entrance to FlatIron school. 

>https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/k4qbq0/wisconsin_regulations_against_online_coding/

This is a major issue since I'm in Wisconsin. Having the channel based out of Texas which is leading the charge on fostering tech and entrepreneurs is helpful. So I can be around a robust software development community. I plan to continue my software developer education while growing the channel. 

It would be super appreciated if you could help fund this channel and the mission behind it. I've been doing a ton of research over the years and Austin, TX city chamber of commerce was the best and even gave me some additional research!

1091,upside-competitions,"Upside is a creator monetisation platform that unlocks premium content and the chance to win prizes from creators on the platform. We are graduates from the KERNEL accelerator and have spent the last 12 months successfully testing our model attracting user deposits and finding a framework that works with payment processors. 

We are now at the stage where we are looking for support from the community to double down and build a production grade product based on the product work we have done to date to support the on-boarding of big name brands like the Australian Football League, Kayo & Binge (Fox TV network), Austereo Network (largest radio network in Australia) amongst other brands. 

Our vision is that this product provides a really simple user onboarding experience to help them build savings whilst also building direct relationships with their favourite content creators. For content creators its a platform where you can build a monetisable and resilient audience with a better incentive structure so you don't have to be clickbaity, extreme or polarising because it's not driven by ad revenue. 

History
Upside was born out of Hack Money, and part of the first Gitcoin KERNEL program. We started with a vision to build an application that would give content creators a means to earn a living wage, users to build a capital position and to build a healthier online experience free from advertising, bots and trolls using the magic of DeFi. We are pleased to say this vision is now quickly becoming reality!

How does it work?

Through and enormous investment in legal compliance work and multiple iterations of the product and we have found a model that satisfies financial and legal compliance and payment processor requirements to be able to onboard general audience. 

This is done through the purchase of redeemable Content Credits on platform which are used to consume content and have the chance to win trade promotion prizes offered by creators who they have subscribed to.  The money used to purchase Content Credits can be redeemed for their purchase price at any time but whilst they are on platform they generate interest from DeFi protocols which is directed to the creators to fund their work. 

Why Upside?
If you are wondering about the name, it’s Upside because there is literally no downside for users who get a chance to win something without having to pay for it. 

Which DeFi platforms are we using? 
User funds are deposited into Sendwyre savings accounts as a MVP to focus on UX (gasless transactions, immediate yield generation and legal compliance) to continue refining the user experience before we start decentralising parts of the flow to become more autonomous & non-custodial using yield optimising protocols like Yearn or Aave.

285,universal-basic-income-ubi,"Universal Basic Income for all Humanity.

Universal basic income (UBI) aims to address economic inequality and provide security through streamed cash to every human on Earth.

It is built on top of Ethereum and the Proof of Humanity protocol. Every human that gets verified, gets a stream of cash in real time at the rate of 1 UBI per hour. This prevents even the cost in gas, effectively becoming a tool that has 99% efficiency when delivering economic aid. 

The Proof of Humanity protocol creates a registry of humans where the only requirement is a 10 second video proof. It rewards challengers who effectively detect sybils (duplicates, deep fakes). No legal or government names are required. 

The Vitalik Effect was an historic day for the project when VB bought and burned 50 ETH worth of UBI. That day we saw the power of Ethereum delivering direct aid without intermediation to all of the 15,000+ verified humans in the protocol. 

The consequences where outstanding. We received testimony from humans who suddenly received a stream of cash that ranged from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand. Thanks to UBI these humans were able to afford visiting their parents after two years of a pandemic; pay their student debt; buy materials to build a first home; get access to housing buy helping pay upfront costs; getting an extra income while facing an oncological disease. 

We saw UBI used mostly in developing countries where crypto is not strictly a matter of an investment opportunity but also a necessity to most. In Cuba we found verified humans that thanks to UBI's rate of ~50 dollars a month were able to support several families.

UBI is a level-playing field technology as we get to build a borderless economy that helps everyone start from the same base line. UBI aims to eradicate the fact that our outcomes in life depend strictly on the lottery of where you were born. 

UBI is how we are able to create an ecosystem where not only individual investors but also society at large can benefit from the economic growth that crypto brings. 

UBI is how we can protect human rights as automation advances in the replacement of monotonous repetitive tasks. Although automation helps bring down the prices of goods; it must also have a regenerative effect in the economy via Universal Basic Income and UBI and Proof of Humanity help to enable that. 

UBI implements Universal Basic Income with free market forces. We envision a world where everyone who has access to the Internet will also have all basic necessities covered by it. 

All of the funds used for this grant will go directly to support UBI via the Humanitarian Vaults available on democracy.earth and the UBI Burner available on ubiburner.com.

We prioritize shipping and gathering feedback as soon as possible to increase iteration cycles and optimize performance. You can see our features like onboarding, tic tac toe, and anonymous payments in the embedded links. Access our playground to touch these functions on your own. Or check out one of our many apps currently available. 

As a team we are focused on experimenting to forge the fastest path to intuitive design and UX for blockchain applications. This grant would help us push the ball forward in this way.

Where the money goes

Donations to this grant will support the upcoming deployment of Grassroots Economics Commons, open-sourcing the deployments protocols for our Commons design patterns, improvements to Praise and the RAD (Reward, Analysis, Distribution) reward systems, as well as the Commons Stack core team.

We have open accounting! All funds raised will be spent transparently in our Iteration 0 Campaign on the Giveth DApp.

What we can do with more funding

Our primary goal is to enable purpose-led communities to deploy regenerative micro-economies Commons based on our technical and cultural design patterns. Our focus is on enabling economies that can create sustainable funding for the development of open-source infrastructure and open research projects within the blockchain space. To achieve this, we will provide a toolkit for communities to create novel, cause-focused economies that we call “Commons”.

In the near term, here are the things we want to achieve:

1. Deployment of the next Commons. Our team will work hand-in-hand with Grassroots Economics Commons to help them deploy our unique cultural and technical builds which constitute a Commons and create their own regenerative economy.  We will bring with us the tools, expertise, and experience from the first Commons deployment, the TEC.

2. Future iterations of Praise as a product. Praise is the Rewards System initiated by Commons Stack to allow communities to acknowledge the value created from small to large contributions across multiple platforms, even the non-technical ones. It has been tried and tested in different communities such as the TEC, Giveth and Commons Stack. The tools developed throughout the process have now been turned into an open-source project.

3. Case studies for the TEC. We want to create and collect case studies that can be used to derive a list of best practices that can help all DAOs learn from the TEC deployment and build a successful future. 


Thank you for your generosity! 🙏

4069,the-ai-commons-algovera,"The Problem of Centralized AI
AI is one of the most powerful technologies that we have access to. Currently, the power of AI is centralized in the hands of a few big companies and universities. This centralization includes many layers of the AI stack such as data, infrastructure (compute), intellectual property (code, patents, know how) and talent (researchers, engineers). Furthermore, the use of these resources is largely dictated by commercial interests in a top-down manner. Often, this results in the development of technologies that are harmful to society (e.g. surveillance, ad clicks). In our experience, generally well-meaning people can be persuaded to work on these technologies through top-down rigid hierarchies. Also, AI continues to automate many jobs and the issue of supporting an AI-dominated economy is little explored.
 
We believe that new types of organizations can take us off our current path. Given the freedom and support to decide on their pursuit, we believe that independent teams will generally work on use cases that are better for the world. Apps can be collectively owned and governed with proceeds flowing into a DAO treasury to be further distributed. Token engineering simulations can be performed to come up with new economic models for the redistribution of value generated by AI. You can read more about our vision for AI ownership here (or listen to a recent podcast). There is a strong open source ethos, online presence and passion for good in the AI community (e.g. HuggingFace, EleutherAI). However, workers tend to contribute to these projects on evening and weekends, while sustaining themselves with salaries from tech companies. Can new mechanisms of funding free more people to work full time on open source and AI for Good?

Community 
Algovera is a community made up of individuals that are passionate about decentralizing AI, i.e. putting AI development and governance in the hands of many rather than a few. Algovera Squads are independent AI teams, funded by Algovera Grants and building on Algovera infrastructure, to create useful AI applications. Our mission is to empower data scientists to work for themselves on their own ideas and keep ownership of their creations. Some our current Squads are:
DeepDeFi: Aiming to save users money when borrowing from popular DeFi protocols (using predictive AI models). You can check out a demo app their website. 
AI Drone Driver: Building a tool to collect synthetic data from virtual 3D worlds to train autonomous drones (e.g. using object detection for vision and natural language processing for decision making). 
Smart NFT Search: Aiming to make anything in the NFT space searchable with text. Check out their web app.
Decentralized Healthcare: The team have created a white paper for HopeDAO, which aims to address problems in mental health clinical trials. They have also been creating smart contracts for decentralized clinical trials.
Safe Brain Computer Interfaces: A team of neuroscientists and data scientists creating algorithms that classify EEG measurements while preserving data privacy and ownership. More information about the hackathon that led to the formation of the team here.
Munchies Index: Building a collection of scripts to mine text data from cannabis social media to teach a pre-trained language model to communicate using the idiomatic patterns of a niche audience. More information about the project here.
Medical Image Classification: A team of independent orthopaedic surgeons and data scientists developing classification models for arthroscopic surgery images. More information about the project here. Check out the tutorial and video of the app that we created on HuggingFace Spaces.
Face Anonymization: Improving fairness of face anonymization algorithms by crowdsourcing data using Web3 technologies. More information about the project here.
ML Model Profit Share: Exploring the use of Arweave Profit Sharing Communities (PSCs) to distribute value generated by AI apps.
DAOkit: Creating a scripting language that integrates crowdsourcing of human intelligence tasks with smart contracts. Check out the original proposal and a demo app.
LoCoFast: Creating a toolkit which would allow one to effectively train fast efficient models for segmentation tasks.

Our community also overlaps with many other Web3 communities and ecosystems:

Ocean Protocol: We are one of the largest community-based projects in the OceanDAO ecosystem (where we’ve been working for over one year, completing 12 grants successfully). We work very closely with many projects in the OceanDAO ecosystem including DataUnion, LYNX, Opscientia and nCight.
Kernel: We learned most of our community practices from our time in Kernel Block 4. We hosted many juntos and created a guild. Many of our oldest members joined. Check out our guild on decentralizing AI. 
Protocol Labs: We are partially funded by the PL ecosystem. We have community members from many PL working groups including bacalhau/IPCS, Network Research (sub-team of Network Goods) and shared-zarr.
DeSci: Many of our community members are heavily involved in the decentralized science world. We hosted a workshop on Decentralized AI at DeSci Berlin.
TEC/TEA/Commons Stack: Some of our community are members of the Trusted Seed and Token Engineering Commons, and alumni of Token Engineering Academy. We have contributed to token engineering software such as TokenSPICE. 
Openmined: We're building connections with the Openmined community through working groups and study groups. 

Infrastructure
Similar to the Web3 stack, we are working to develop the decentralized AI stack. This is the collection of technologies needed to build and deploy decentralized AI applications.  

Data Unions: We've been partnering with data providers and domain experts to build machine learning applications including generative art, face anonymization, medical image classification, and brain-computer interface algorithms. 
Data Marketplaces: We've observed points of friction with using Web3 marketplaces and we're building tools to make the workflow for data scientists easier. These include integrating MetaMask with JupyterLab (a popular computing environment for data scientists) to simplify the process of downloading data and running compute jobs, and integrating data science platforms like HuggingFace with the Ocean marketplace. We are building an AI marketplace consisting of machine learning datasets and algorithms, and app demonstrations.
Storage: We've started working to make it easier for data scientists to use decentralized storage solutions, such as IPFS, Filecoin, Ceramic and Lit Protocol.
Private AI: These techniques have the potential to open up new use cases for AI. We are currently running a study group on the foundations of private AI course by Openmined and exploring how to use their open source software in our stack. 
DAOs: We're creating a DAO framework designed specifically for the needs of distributed teams of data scientists. This will enable actions that aren't possible in other DAO frameworks such as publishing co-owning assets (e.g. datasets, algorithms and apps) and sharing the value generated.

Imagine your DAO members can cut through the noise of endless forum posts and get a clear, crisp signal of how the proposal will affect KPIs or metrics. 
Imagine you are a DAO member with a record of your forecasts and how accurate they were. Imagine how this record of your thinking will affect your role and profession in the DeFi space, and earning a living on these decisions.

Non-custodiality of user outcome token shares (already developed).
Integration with Realty.eth to get reliable on-chain, crowd-sourced confirmation of real events which affect prediction markets (with the possibility of arbitration) (partially developed).
Generic ERC20 support as collateral for prediction markets, which currently only support WETH (to be developed).
Improved Aragon ecosystem integration, such as automatically triggering specific actions based on the resolution outcome of a prediction market (to be developed).

To really get to where we want to get to though, we need conditional markets. Conditional markets are prediction markets that ask the user to make a forecast on the condition of another event. 

An example would be asking the question of how much liquidity will be in certain Uniswap pools IF they renew yield farming. This could be represented with the help of two intertwined prediction markets, and information derived from trading these two markets could be used to make informed decisions about the topic at hand.

This is the last step in having something that can finally take futarchy from theory to practice.

1565,demystifi-security-in-metamask,"Introduction

Extropy.io is a blockchain consultancy based in Oxford, UK. We have a team of blockchain engineers with over 20 years experience. Some of our core specialisms include blockchain security and auditing.

The unprecedented rise in DeFi popularity has also brought a significant rise in scams and concerns regarding security. Our goal is to protect traders and their investments, and uphold the integrity of the DeFi ecosystem. 

DemystiFi won a prize at ETHGlobal 2020 with Pokt Network. https://medium.com/pocket-network/pocket-bounty-winners-of-the-ethonline-hackathon-by-ethglobal-ea7957b7ac4c

Watch our submission video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv2naHXeeko&t=2s

Project Description

DeFi has brought the financial freedom to trade and invest without a central authority.

The markets have been turbulent recently and we have seen first hand how simple it is to manipulate prices and mislead investors. As a result, this has created a level of distrust in DeFi firms. DeFi has helped further the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem, however its longevity could be limited unless there are more tools for integrity and transparency within the space. 

The Extropy team have the skills and expertise to build an effective tool that would provide users with a level of security that is currently not available.

The 3 pillars for better security in DeFi are: due diligence, auditing, and insurance. Due diligence can often be overlooked by peers offering advice via social media, auditing is not performed as a standard, and comprehensive insurance is famously absent from the DeFi world. 

However, by providing instant and intuitive feedback during the user experience, the security in DeFi can be enhanced. Our solution takes the guess-work or heavy researching out for traders, and does all the hard work for them.

The Problem

Naive investors are losing their funds from trusting projects that use poorly constructed or malicious smart contracts. The promise of high returns drives investors to trust the word of the project team or those they see as verifiable sources on social media instead of being informed by unbiased and educated sources. 

Since the technical understanding required to properly audit the smart contracts isn’t trivial and suitable tools for verifying the code aren’t commonplace, too much trust is placed in the projects.

Main ideas, models and assumptions

By building on top of MetaMask, which has earned its place in the DeFi world as a reliable tool, users are able to make better informed decisions without having to change their workflow or learn a new system. The information provided protects those most at risk by increasing transparency and preventing market manipulation and scams.

The concept uses data from previous exploits and builds a library based on demonstrated attack vectors. This information is then used as an informative feedback to the user, explaining why a smart contract may not be trustable and how this was leveraged in the past.

Technical Description

The smart contract should be posted to etherscan.io, without this it is impossible to audit the code. This also provides the contract address, which allows linking of the code to the public address.

By utilising the snaps extension of MetaMask, we can incorporate additional checks into the user flow. This would:

1. Check the receiving address against the library of known, malicious contract addresses. 
2. Notify the user of any known exploits related to the smart contract. 


MetaMask Architecture Diagram



Application Goals using the S.M.A.R.T methodology

Specific: Increased transparency. Investors can make better informed decisions when trading, resulting in less market manipulation and ultimately, better accountability / responsibility from smart contract owners, because investors will have the ability for better decision making.

Measurable: Fewer instances of malicious / negligent projects causing a loss of investor funds.

Assignable: A team of experienced blockchain engineers at Extropy.io

Realistic: Library of flagged contract addresses and specific exploits created. Modified MetaMask source code which calls API with contract address.

Time-related: 6 months, includes building, testing and iteration.
 
Business Viability 

Value proposition
The data from the public sphere is used to build a verifiable database, to be called by the modified MetaMask code. The database can also be used by third parties to help improve security outside of MetaMask users, improving overall transparency and trust in DeFi.

How our solution differentiates from our competitors’ solutions
Competing solutions offer databases of known malicious behaviour in decentralised finance, to this we add:

- Plugin tools for popular cryptocurrency wallets to alert users when they interact with potentially unsafe contracts.
- Static Analysis of smart contracts which raises a red flag for known exploits, and a green light for secure DeFi projects.
- A DeFi community education platform to educate users of the risks involved in decentralised finance and how to invest safely.

Our target customers

- DeFi investors and traders.
- DeFi firms looking for better transparency / accountability / safety in the space.

Our target end-users

- DeFi investors and traders.

Market Strategy

- Twitter - most if not all DeFi updates / resources are available here.
- DeFi education and news platforms such as Ledger Insights, DeFi Weekly.

Business Viability

- Feasibility: Extropy have a team of experienced blockchain engineers and have extensive experience in security, DLT development and user experience.

- Viability: Credible DeFi firms are likely investors because they have an interest in users avoiding insecure platforms and using theirs instead.

- Desirability: The target audience requires a degree of safety and peace of mind when trading. Extropy’s tool can be used at their disposal. In terms of its repeated use, it’s likely that end users would utilise the tool every time they trade with a new DeFi firm..

1323,resource-network,"ReSource is a resource-based mutual credit stable coin protocol with an accompanying front-end commerce application and wallet. 

Participating in the ReSource mutual credit network allows a business to increase turnover with a cyclical economy model, by accessing interest-free credit and facilitating multilateral barter exchange through a mutually guaranteed credit network. Businesses can collateralize resources - tokenized business debt in the form of redeemable ERC-20 coupons pegged to goods & services - to mint ""Resources"" (rUSD). rUSD is a unit of account on the Ethereum blockchain, with each rUSD account comprising a balance - which can be positive or negative - and a credit line, from which rUSD can be minted. 

On the ReSource app, businesses can list any product or service and price it in rUSD. We are building a circular economy of value between our first two types of users: co-living properties and freelancers. For improved user experience, gas fees are currently covered automagically, and lay users need not hold ETH. Our MVP app is live on Ethereum and you can interact with it here.

We’re seeking financial contributions to build out the network and infrastructure for the ReSource Network. We are also calling in non-financial contributions of skills from the community.

Mutual credit is a financial primitive yet to see a significant implementation on blockchain. Mutual credit is a long-standing alternative monetary system to the dominant paradigm based on compounding interest, and thrives in periods of economic downturn. The most prominent mutual credit network in existence is the Wir Bank in Switzerland, launched in the 1930's at the height of the Great Depression.

ReSource has an Ethereum-based inter-coupon exchange & barter system (unreleased), which will add coupon liquidity. ReSource has integrated Wyre for fiat and crypto payment processing, and is planning to integrate Matic Network to reduce Ethereum gas fees.

The problems we’re addressing are access to credit, control and governance over credit systems designed to serve SME's, tools and resources for SME's to survive the economic downturn triggered by the covid-19 pandemic, and (questionable) resilience of fiat-backed monetary systems.

The governance model for the ReSource Network is currently being developed, and is inspired by MakerDao. New rUSD issuers will be curated and verified by a network of existing rUSD issuers.

2569,smartdeposit-guard-your-deposit,"Smartdeposit is a deposit platform built based on blockchain technology. Traditional online deposit requires a third party with strong endorsement to receive the deposit, but this project takes all nodes in a blockchain as the treasury and many problems have been avoided. The smart contract of this project is deployed on the blockchain, and the server uses Netlify. The DAPP project, developed using the React framework, is based on Web3 provided by MetaMask as a login, so users can only log in through MetaMask at the moment.

What problem do we solve?
Traditional deposit is usually collected by the service provider or entrusted to a third party, and the fund is not controllable and transparent. It is often the case that the service provider misappropriates the deposit. If the company has a crisis, the user can hardly get the deposit back on time. We couldn’t find a one-stop solution, so we built it.

We can solve the trust issues faced in the use of deposit scenarios, such as rental services. There are countless cases of disputes arising from lease issues, and we need to spend a long time and energy to solve them, and even so many cases cannot be solved finally. In addition, there is also the case of deposit in advance in commercial contracts, and it also happens that the deposit is not returned after the contract expires. We can use it in the following scenarios: Car Rental, Rental Housing, Contract Work, Franchise Store, Educational Training, Save Up Money Jointly and Cross Chain Transaction.

What solution does Smartdeposit offer?
The user creates a smart contract by entering the deposit amount and locking time, and the deposit will be locked in the smart contract. Stakeholders and Payer both can view the deposit details in real time. The deposit can only be retrieved after the locking time is reached. If there is a dispute, it can be resolved in time through the vote of the preselected referees. All processes are transparent to protect users' rights and interests from infringement.

390,wallet-notify-a-standardized-way-of-sending-push-,"Ethereum Notifications

Currently, there is no way to notify DApp users, and this leads to issues like poor retention and not ideal UX. This is the first of a hopefully larger scope of work to notify users of events within the Ethereum ecosystem.
Website: https://walletnotify.org/ 3
Devpost: https://devpost.com/software/wallet-notify 5

Why is this needed?
DeFi platforms need a way to notify users when debt positions are about to be closed.
ENS needs a way to notify users when domains are about to expire.
MolochDAO, DAOStack, Aragon and Colony need a way to notify users when voting periods start or about to end.
Upgradability mechanisms need ways to notify users of upcoming upgrades.

Essential goals for the standard:
Send notifications to Ethereum addresses
Send notifications to Multi-sig wallets
Batch send many notifications
Allow inclusion of
text
logo
target url (e.g. click to navigate to proposal page)
transacion details (e.g. click to interact with a DApp)
Spam resistance

Additional goals for the standard:
Manage notification preferences
Allow/Block senders
Allow/Block specific topics from a sender
Encryption

Scope
Phase 1:
Establishment of the standard
Phase 2:
Build infrastructure and tools for its easy adoption
Docs, smart contract deployment, npm package, website
Phase 3:

For the past 1.5 years, we've been diligently running a # of high-quality technical summits that have been 100% free & open to all. Now - with the world slowly getting vaccinated - we're ready & so excited to bring our community (all of you lovely folks) out of the metaverse and into the real world. 

Our Focus:
We plan to run IRL hackathons, summits, and invite-only retreats for speakers & core community members. We are also productizing & building an open, turnkey NFT event ticketing platform. 

Where Will Events Take Place:
Our community is global & depending on what countries are open, we'll tailor our event scheduling so that we'll have a presence in most regions. We'll be running our first event in either NY, Miami, or Lisbon this summer / fall.  

What Will The Money Be Used For:
This grant money will be used to pay for the venue at IRL events & help fund our IRL globetrotting events (all of which you will be invited to). TLDR; If you got value out of our virtual events during the pandemic, we guarantee you'll like hanging with us IRL a gazillion times more. 

Support Us At Dystopia Labs:
We have a solid track record and have contributed a lot to the crypto community over the past 1.5 years. We have never asked our community for money nor have we actively tried to earn funds through Gitcoin Grants till today. So please donate so that we can bring Dystopia Labs events into the real world (and onboard more devs into the space).

Check out this launch article where we’ve introduced Scribble!

Diligence ❤️ Open Source, so we’re committing to the development of Scribble. And, we’d love to work together with the community to make Scribble better than we can on our own.

That’s why we’ve created this grant!
We’ll take the funds raised through this grant and re-invest all of it back into the open-source community through gitcoin bounties.

Grant Funded Bounties
So, what bounties are we looking to fund through this grant?

We set up five initial categories:
* 🎓Education
* 💰Open Property Fund
* ↔️ Translate
* 👩‍💻 CLI and Language Development
* 🐛 Bugs

🎓 Education
One of the most important factors for Verification tools are learning and knowledge sharing.

We’ll set up bounties for creating educational content such as:
* Tutorials and blog posts
* Documentation
* Examples of smart contracts with Scribble annotations

💰Open Property Fund
Our primary goal with Scribble is to make smart contracts more secure. For this to happen, we need to write annotations first. That is why we’ll fund bounties for annotating public smart contract projects.

Scribble’s principal goal is to make the Ethereum ecosystem more secure, and this is the first step!

↔️ Translate
There are a lot of verification tools already out there, and each of them uses their own language for writing properties. 

We’ll fund bounties for tools that translate Scribble annotations into these languages. This way, developers will only need to write properties once! 

We’re currently considering translations into the following specification languages:
Act
VeriSol   

💡 Let us know of the tool/language that you want to use with Scribble!

👩‍💻 CLI and Language Development
We have only just released Scribble, which means that there are still loads of things that we want to build. 

Macro Support
Once you get started writing Scribble annotations, you’ll find that you’re repeating similar patterns. 

Of course, you can copy-paste to save yourself some time, but macro’s and predicates are going to be that much better! 

Syntax Highlighting
Syntax highlighting is one of the simplest, and effective code understanding techniques out there! 

Having syntax highlighting for Scribble will bring a huge quality of life improvement for Scribble users.

NatSpec integration
Scribble annotations are currently just basic comments, which is unfortunate because the Ethereum community has developed an awesome standard called *NatSpec*. We’d love to adapt Scribble to work within this standard!

🐛 Bugs
Every software project has bugs, Scribble included, which is why we’ll welcome (and fund 😁) contributions fixing bugs in Scribble.

3935,determine-if-use-of-the-widely-prescribed-drug-cy,"Investigator: Suzanne Angeli, PhD

Unmet Need: Aging is the single largest risk factor for disease in developed countries and is greatly increasing the proportion of the population at risk for socially and economically important brain aging diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.

Background: Cyclosporin A (CsA) is a widely-prescribed immunosuppressant drug used in organ-transplant recipients. A fascinating recent study showed that organ-transplant recipients on lifelong immunosuppressive drugs a have staggeringly low incidence of Alzheimer’s disease compared to the general population (Taglialatela et al., 2015), suggesting that drugs like CsA may have protective effects on brain aging. In addition to its immunosuppressive properties, CsA is also know to suppress mitochondrial dysfunction, one of the major drivers of brain aging. Amazingly, CsA does not cross the blood brain barrier, suggesting that its protective effects may be achieved by treating peripheral (non-neuronal) tissues. 

A major caveat to the use of CsA is its significant side effects, such as liver damage, due to the very high dose administered to patients that is required to suppress organ-transplant rejection. However, it is unknown if lower doses of CsA that bypass serious side-effects could slow down brain aging.

Proposal:
1. 	Determine the mechanism of how CsA suppresses mitochondrial dysfunction. C. elegans are microscopic nematodes widely used in the aging field and have led to major advances in our understanding of human aging. Using this simple model organism, I have previously observed that CsA can suppress mitochondrial dysfunction (Angeli et al., 2021), but its cellular drug targets are unclear. Using powerful genetic tools, this aim will uncover potentially novel cellular targets of CsA.
2. 	Determine if low to intermediate doses of CsA improve brain function in normal aging mice. Like humans, aging mice experience a decline in motor and cognitive functions. This aim will determine if CsA can slow down brain aging in mice and potentially serve as preclinical data for humans.

Impact: Slowing down brain aging is of upmost biomedical importance. One major hurdle that has faced treating brain aging and brain disorders is the difficulty of delivering drugs directly to the brain. However, the Taglialatela et al. study and growing research suggests that targeted delivery to the brain may not be necessary to improve brain health, which could revolutionize how we identify and treat brain aging.",https://www.buckinstitute.org/,-1,-1,139,-1,-1,https://github.com/suzanneangeli,2

2010,nifty-taxi,"I set out to build a simple Figma plugin to allow people to mint an NFT from within the app. A simple one night job, I thought. The Figma Gods thought otherwise and looked down upon my efforts with sadness. While conceptually quite simple, I found that web3 can't integrate with Figma, and will require middleware to create a token via platform APIs. Disintermediation pls :(

With this in mind and with a wholly different challenge ahead, I'm creating a small desktop app which leverages deeplink magic to get artwork from your Favorite Design Tool™ (not just Figma!) to Your Favorite NFT Platform™.

Initial features will include:
Figma: PNG outputs to NFT platforms with APIs
Figma: Include SVG data with the NFT (optional) (hosted .svg)
Figma: Include Figma file with the NFT as metadata (optional) (hosted .fig file, potentially on IPFS)

Future features may cater to other applications, such as Photoshop.

Rationale behind Desktop vs Web
I think hosted middleware with the ability to parse your files and scrape data is in opposition to the idea of Blockchain, however, if it proves to be a significantly better experience, then Web will be the go-to option.

With your support, Jovian, The Bigger Pie & Panvala will empower a working group to take on research & behavioral design to begin helping DAOs achieve gender diversity.

Conduct the first study of record into recruiting & career advancement for individuals working in DAOs that takes into account gender perspective.

Collect & analyze data to objectively measure the impact of gender bias if it exists.

Design & implement new processes that reduce/remove gender bias.

Report on the results of these experiments.


Why balancing gender matters

It’s not just about getting more females into the space; it’s about combining the perspectives of feminine and masculine to produce better decisions. Without different perspectives in a forum, we assume that the default voice is neutral, all-encompassing truth. When in fact, the default masculine perspective, is a perspective just like every other gender. Creating gender diverse teams enriches the collective with checks and balances, testing our basic assumptions and expanding our range of preferences. Upping the gender mix can also introduce new skillsets into Web3 that are missing in the ranks of technical, business, or community professionals.

Balancing gender representation in teams has been shown by studies to increase overall collective intelligence. For DAOs that are governed by member votes, increasing collective intelligence is 👍. However, a subgroup must reach a critical mass of 30% representation in order to affect changes in policy, so we have our work cut out for us. Female representation in most DAOs is still far below 30%. Strong initiatives for gender inclusion are highly valuable, especially as the DAO space continues to grow.

Gender inclusion is not a new territory for social researchers, yet the lessons learned elsewhere have not yet been adapted and applied to working styles within a DAO. We're excited to adapt and extend what's worked well for integrating real world teams for Web3. We're even a little bullish that we can make this transformation more swiftly with strong community visibility & support.  

The role of technology should always be to make people's lives better. We need diverse teams at the table during ideation, design and implementation.

“Appreciation App” is a web application that enables event attendees to recognize the effort of speakers by voting on them with Props - internal Ethereum token in our App. Props are a reflection of participants' opinion about a particular speaker's performance during the event 

This voting system helps to build a public speakers brand and share attendees satisfaction from particular presentations with others. At the same time, it offers an informative value for attendees and events’ organizers - in a form of publicly available speakers’ ranking based on blockchain. What’s more, it increases speakers' involvement and encourages them to prepare high-quality speeches.

Are you a Speaker? 

Deliver high-quality speeches, get the gratitude for your involvement and become a top Props scorer! Being listed on the platform will help to build your speaker brand and recognition! 🏆

Are you an Event Organizer?

Search for and invite the best speakers using the Props ranking. The quality speakers will make attendees feel they get the most value out of participating in your event. 🚀

Are you an Attendee?

Use our Props ranking to participate in events with outstanding speakers. Always choose the finest speeches during the conference, and get the most from being an attendee. 💡


Some possible features to add in the future:

Creating a Marketplace, where appreciation tokens can be exchanged for real-world services, such as education material, courses, etc.
Data collected via the App (in the future it will be stored on the public blockchain) can be used to provide metrics and analytics of attendance
Group initiatives - tokens can be raised to fund speakers’ joint initiatives, i.e. charitable donations, topic-oriented conferences, etc.
Once we achieve the appropriate scale we could serve as an “Event organizer assistant”. We would help to take strategic decisions, such as the date, place, target group, etc., based on historical events. We would connect with Facebook’s and Meetup’s API for data collection purposes.


Our story

Appreciation App is the idea that won the “Igrzyska Blockchain” Hackathon in December 2019. The whole concept was born a long time before the event, but only the win in this hackathon gave us a chance to validate our idea for the first time. It was a huge motivational boost that encouraged us to continue the Appreciation App project. 


Why Gitcoin Grants?

We would like to build a supportive, positive and just grateful event community that would be oriented on appreciating speakers’ effort and constant feedback. The public ranking of Props collected by speakers will be based on blockchain that’s why we think Gitcoin Grants platform is a perfect place for us to validate our idea. We want to start as soon as possible to give a hand to the event organizers who need to change their events to remote due to COVID-19. We would like to support them in these hard moments to let all remote attendees have a great experience and make the most from the great speeches.

It’s like yield farming the solarpunk world bank that mints new fiat money to pump planetary harmonization.



Hello old friends! If you're new, welcome! If you've contributed to us before, welcome again!

We are 100% community supported right now. Funds raised through this Gitcoin round will go towards operations and collaborator compensation. This will help us retain talent and develop our MVP.

We've come a long way since our last funding round. Last round we were very early. We were gathering around a problem space. Since then we've developed novel tokenomics, attracted major talent, and forged powerful partnerships.

We are done relying only on corporations and consumers to pay out of pocket to the planet-healing heroes on the front lines.

We're building a decentralized economic engine to create new money as the planet is healed.

Why do imperialists and extractive capitalists get to print USD to make the 1% richer?

Why do tyrants get to print rubles to fund wars?

It's senseless.

Together, we'll be seedin' (sEDN) the roots of regeneration. We're going to bootstrap the carbon coin sEDN to set a global floor price for carbon.

We are creating an economic engine that accelerates the pace at which we heal our planet, starting with carbon removal.

The ""money printer go brrrrr"" that funds the public good.

220 billion tons of carbon needs to be removed from the atmosphere if we are to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, however funding for CDR solutions remains underdeveloped. We are building a demand engine for high-quality, high-durability, carbon removals and reductions [see Carbon Terminology 101 below]. 

A new mental model for carbon markets

The Eden Dao starts with the belief that the first reserve asset of the 21st century is carbon. If we can collectively come to believe that an unfucked planet has a fuck ton of value, then we can form the basis for a new world reserve asset — the same way that historically gold as a reserve asset was perpetuated through belief.

We're building the world's decentralized ""Global Carbon Reserves"" to create a source of stable and increasing value to back the minting of new money. This new store of value is the foundation of our decentralized ""Global Carbon Reward"" of $1 for high quality, high durability carbon removals and reductions.

With this we intend to inject new money into the global economy to fund the rapid development of new carbon removal capacity by through a systemic impact on carbon markets.

Later down the line, as the carbon actually gets captured and an official ""offset"" is minted in the real world, this is property of the DAO and can be sold to corporations and institutions for immediate retirement.

This is an opportunity for investors around the world to participate in the creation of a new global institution that rewards and funds the preservation of our precious planet. 

How will it work?

The Eden Dao is developing a new protocol, the full details of which can be explored in our Gitbook. Eden Daoists versed in the DeFi Arts will be able to bond USD stablecoins into the protocol to own a piece of the world's Global Carbon Reserves — sEDN. You can bond sEDN for our governance token gEDN, which is backed by an increasing amount of sEDN.

Carbon project developers are also rewarded with sEDN — 1 sEDN for every year of permanence in their carbon removals. When carbon project developers are rewarded, the Global Carbon Reserves mints new sEDN rewards to all gEDN holders. 

The sEDN underlying your gEDN can be ""harvested"" to mint new stablecoins. We've been exploring multiple avenues with the folks behind Rari Capital, Concave.lol, the Celo Reserve.

============================================

Carbon Terminology 101

Carbon offsets: any activity that compensates for the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) or other greenhouse gases by providing for an emission reduction elsewhere. Because greenhouse gases are widespread in Earth’s atmosphere, the climate benefits from emission reductions regardless of where such cutbacks occur. If carbon reductions are equivalent to the total carbon footprint of an activity, then the activity is said to be “carbon neutral.” Carbon offsets can be bought, sold, or traded as part of a carbon market as carbon credits. (Britannica)

Carbon credit: One credit corresponds to one metric ton of reduced, avoided or removed CO2 or equivalent GHG. Credits can be used by a company or an individual to compensate for the emission of one ton of CO2 or equivalent gases. When a credit is used for this purpose, it becomes an offset. It is moved to a register for retired credits, or retirements, and it is no longer tradable.
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) : refers to anything that removes and sequesters previously emitted atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). CDR is distinct from emissions reduction technologies, which reduce the entry of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. CDR is generally split into two categories: natural carbon removal and technological carbon removal. Natural carbon removal is the uptake and storage of CO2 by ecosystems, such as forests and the ocean. Technological carbon removal utilises processes that actively remove carbon from the air, such as direct air carbon capture storage technologies. (DNZ, EESI)
Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCMs): Voluntary carbon markets allow carbon emitters to offset their unavoidable emissions by purchasing carbon credits emitted by projects targeted at removing or reducing GHG from the atmosphere. Institutions can participate in the voluntary carbon market either individually or as part of an industry-wide scheme, such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, which was set up by the aviation sector to offset its greenhouse gas emissions. They differ from “compliance markets”, which are currently limited to specific regions and regulated by state or national governments. Voluntary carbon credits are more fluid, unrestrained by boundaries set by nation states or political unions. They also have the potential to be accessed by every sector of the economy instead of a limited number of industries. (S&P)

The Best of DeFi in 1 Upgradable Contract

This grant is to support an upgradable smart contract that always incorporates the best features of DeFi. 

Reflection, Burn, Liquidity farming, bonuses, staking, locking, self-regulation, and more new techniques as they emerge in the market.

This way we always stay on top, guaranteed that our smart contract is always on top of the trend :)

And you, the user make the safest and highest APY in the market ;)

About WATERWOOD

Waterwood is an audited dual coin ecosystem where WATER tokens are used to generate WOOD tokens as dividends.

The network allows you to make money every 3 seconds, with bonuses up to 500x.

Waterwood is the first Cryptocurrency to produce Negative Inflation while generating APY higher than 500%, with no central authority involved.


Why Waterwood:
NEGATIVE INFLATION, CONTROLLED BY THE PEOPLE
WATER and WOOD aren't subjected to inflation and are controlled by the people
WOOD's inflation is determined by offer and demand. Regulation by the market offers invaluable, never seen before advantages:


SAFEST APY, CONTROLLED BY MARKET FORCES
APY is Automatically Optimized for Risk vs Reward. The Market takes care of everything
WaterWood, is first-in-kind to experiment with a dual coin that combines market wisdom, and swift mathematical formulas, only made possible by smart contracts.
As price and burn ratio are driven by offer and demand, WOOD APY systematically stabilizes at an optimal risk/reward ratio. This is a unique innovation, made only possible through decentralized blockchain technology.


SECURE BY DESIGN & PROFESSIONALLY AUDITED
All business logic is executed via Audited Smart Contracts so your funds are safe and secure. No 3rd parties are involved in fund movement and transactions are performed on-chain.

SELF-PROGRAMMED FOR GROWTH
A Financial Mechanism that perpetuates stability and growth over time
Upward cycle 
As people lock-in WATER. WATER increases in rarity. Price goes up

As people burn WOOD. WOOD increases in rarity. Price goes up

Downward cycle 
As WATER rises in price, people unlock WATER and sell 

As WOOD rises in price, people cash-in WOOD in the market

Steady long-term growth
As liquidity comes in, short-term ups and downs self regulate WaterWood APY that reaches a competitive rate among all yields in the market, keeping the price of WATER and WOOD increasing as more people join in. In the long term, this cycle is healthy, like the ecological cycle of WATER and WOOD in nature.

2880,economics-design-education,"TLDR: We want to increase the video and audio quality of these educational content. Seeking $2,500 per month to increase video production quality and audio quality. 

Why we do what we do
Economics Design's Education seeks to educate people in the crypto space about fundamentals. That includes economics, incentive mechanisms, financial economics, to name a few. Ecosystems are the new business models, empowering individuals and creating decentralised organisations for the people, governed by the people. That is transformational.

For the past 1 year, we have been working hard to get the process up and running, and to test the type of content that people are looking for. Now, we can double down on increasing the aesthetic of this, so more people can learn and benefit.


Why this matters
As we move towards that future, the devil is in the details. What is the economics behind such models? How do we implement and execute it? What are the mathematics and models that allows smart contracts to run? What technology are there and how can we exploit the technology to gain more efficiency? These are some of the things we cover.


Why should you care
Innovation in the crypto, DeFi and tokenisation space is growing at an exponential rate. There is a real cost in lagging behind and not understand what is going on. Thus, Economics Design Education is here to help you to get comfortable with the space.


Who should care
That includes:
retail users who want to understand the economics of various protocols
retail investors who are seeking fundamentals instead of just financial and technical analysis
capital market looking to enter the DeFi space
developers looking for new ideas to innovate upon

What are we doing
In general, we are teaching how to design, analyse and understand the fundamental economics of a protocol. That is based on a simple and easy to digest Economics Design Framework.

Economics Design Education is doing this in a few ways:

Book — highly recommended research book on the economics, mechanisms and math of token economics and DeFi
YouTube — (1) in-depth educational piece on a protocol case study, explaining the mechanisms, incentives and token design (2) explanation of specific tech innovation like ""what is quadratic funding?""
Newsletter — weekly newsletter on a protocol case study or a complicated topic like derivatives financial engineering or DEX math model
Podcast — interviews with podcast developers for users keen on more primary research
Webinars — sessions with leading experts in the space, to discuss topic focused hard questions
Research — (1) weekly research topic via newsletter on finance and fundamental DeFi topics (2) fundamental segment analysis in DeFi
Online course — deep dive into the economics and mechanisms behind how all these systems work

Do people care about this?
TLDR: Yes.
Yes, we are getting great reach and engagement with our educational content.
Main feedback we keep getting: ""your content is high quality. Can you please increase the video quality?""

Numbers to show that instead of people's feedback
Research book: 500 books sold to all 6 continents
YouTube: 15-20% month on month growth, monthly reach of 110k impression and 10k views
Newsletter: 3 types of newsletters for 3 types of individuals, with 50% engagement rates

What we'll do this round of grants?
We aim to get 500,000 subscribers for YouTube and Newsletters in 2021. How? Increasing the video quality.
Hire a video producer → increase the quality of video, editing, animation, visual appeal
Increase the audio quality → mic, audio engineer, materials in the filming space for better acoustic
Continue on the monthly themes of 2021
Active community online to continue the education, between new videos coming out (Probably Discord)
""How to"" videos of how to use various DeFi protocols

How can you help?
Every DAI and ETH you provide goes to increasing the video quality and support the content of the channel!

Thank you so much!

The Distributed Governance Score Framework (DGSF) is a project for establishing a theoretical background on digital organizations based on organization design/science, and analytical tools for evaluating digital organizations.

For this grant, I am specifically focusing on the DAO Index. 

The DAO Index is an analytical tool (a self assessment questionnaire; aka a social audit tool) and open database of ratings (and scores) of DAOs  based on their adherence to a set of core organizing principles (eight as questionnaire version 0.8). The foundation for the DAO Index is based on the DGSF’s theoretical background on digital organizations. The DAO Index provides an ancillary assessment of a DAO’s governance and ethical (or distributed governance) practices. Through the questionnaire, we can score, rate, and benchmark a DAO’s adherence to the core organizing principles.

The core principles currently are:

Broad stakeholder participation
Cross-border coordination
Information & data transparency
Human-centered algorithmic governance
Practicing DAO cooperativism
Cultural patterns and brand
DAO-2-DAO interaction
Social Technology

Regarding funding, the funds will be used for:

Testing and validating the self-assessment questionnaire 
Conducting audits and review on DAOs with the self-assessment questionnaire
Identifying the DAO problem space
Recruiting new people to learn about the basics of organization design and train on the questionnaire

2993,the-north-light-project,"Today, people who have internet connections are often overwhelmed by data overload.

Computer technology has been climbing exponentially, and is now progressing more each hour than it did in its entire first 90 years.

It is estimated that computation power will surpass human brainpower in 2023, which is just two years away from now.

This affects many aspect of our lives. Some of the drawbacks we are experiencing at right now include the prevalence of fake news, data fatigue, distrust in news reports and statistic data, and an overwhelmingly common attitude of indifference. The words we often use to describe people are:

Aloof
Impassive
Insensitive
Lukewarm
Unsympathetic
Apathetic

Imagine in your mind that a person’s brainpower, their ability to absorb outside information, is like a piece of white paper, and each data point they receive from the outside is like a little black dot dropped on this piece of white paper. Starting from ancient times, as we had more and more exposure to data, there were more and more black dots dropped onto this white paper. At some point of time, there will be so many black dots that they completely cover the white paper, and the white paper now turns black. That will be the time when computation power surpasses the brainpower of human beings. 

At this time, we will lose our ability for clear, conscious thinking. Common sense will get shuffled away by what seems like the common practices of society, broadcasted in fake news. Objective news will cease to exist, buried underneath bot generated fake news in just a few minutes after the original news is published. Wise people will be afraid to speak out on public concerns, because the moment they speak out, they will be personally ridiculed and their content altered, pirated and smeared by AI controlled bots.

When this happens, the human race will enter a dark age, an age where we are blinded by the sheer volume of data, isolated by bots, silenced by the noise and impoverished by market manipulation.

When such a situation happens, the human race will lose our way. Civilization will sound like a fairytale. People will lose their judgment on what is right and what is wrong, and they will lose their conscience, their integrity and their soundness of mind.

This is a problem that needs to be solved for the common good, and this is a giant leap that the human race has to take.

The clue to solving this problem is in nature. It has been with us since the creation of the earth.

Every moment in our lives is unique, and nothing stays the same. The data that occurs at each millisecond is different. Look at the night sky, for example. The earth is constantly rotating in its orbit, and the location and brightness of the stars in the sky are constantly changing. In this constantly changing world, human beings learned to navigate the ocean thousands of years ago. How did they do it? They learned to read the constant patterns in the constantly changing night sky. 

Polaris, commonly the North Star or Pole Star, is the brightest star of the constellation Ursa Minor. Because Polaris lies nearly in a direct line with the Earth's rotational axis, ""above"" the North Pole—the north celestial pole—Polaris stands almost motionless in the sky, and all the stars of the northern sky appear to rotate around it. Therefore, it makes an excellent fixed point from which to draw measurements for celestial navigation and astrometry.

People in ancient times learned to read the north star and use it to guide them when sailing through the ocean.

For the human race, it is the same story. Our common sense and our judgement of what is right and wrong are knowledge accumulated over generations. They apply to all human generations, races and countries. They need to be preserved and applied to society, integrated to the current moment and actively advocated for and adapted to current events.

The problem is that it is difficult to advocate for common sense. Our media is basically a pile of sand. Whatever gets dumped on top of the pile gets people’s attention for a few seconds, and is then buried under the new layer of sand that gets dumped on top. When most of the sand is generated by bots, it is impossible to pick real, authentic information out of a pile of junk.

Common sense usually stays in the history books. You cannot drag George Washington out of a history book and ask him to give an opinion on current political affairs. And if you ask an economist about an economic problem, 9 out of 10 will give you an ambiguous answer, because they want to keep their jobs, and not be accused of anything outrageous.

But if you ask people who are affected by economic problems, and give them 3 options that can help them improve their situation, they will probably give you honest answers, and actively help you to improve those 3 options.

Common sense, the best practice for how to run human societies, needs to be implemented as a decentralized system, not managed by any government or controlled by any society. It needs to be actively maintained by the people who care about it, who live the outcome, who actively advocate it, and who use the best practices to address the current issues in their societies and improve them. 

When political agendas are removed from the recording and registration of best practices, complicated problems become much easier to solve, and complicated issues have much simpler answers. People have more courage to speak out and be their authentic selves. 

I call this project the North Light project. This is a decentralized project to preserve and allow people to reference and use best practices that accumulated from generations of human societies. So that no matter how much data gets generated by computers and AI, people can reference the best practices, and manage their societies in a wise and peaceful manner.

There are some basic requirements for this system.
The user interface is very simple and easy to use. 
It has categories of topics, each addressing a different type of issue.
It leverages blockchain registry, and records authentic content surrounding each topic.
People can create immutable and timestamped digital content to be stored in the system.
It can verify that the person who contributes the content is an authentic human being, who is willing to prove that they are the creator of the content.
It allows users to easily enter keywords, and pull out a few recipes of best practices for solving a real-world issue.
It has a survey or poll system, for people to give feedback on implementing or using a best practice in their society, the problems they solve, the outcomes they achieve, and the improvements that need to be made.
The system can consolidate feedback and provide granular variations and recipes for users to customize the best practices to address the specific issues in their society.

4181,say-dao,"For the past few years, we have been on a mission to design a decentralised, multi-component and open-source platform called SAY to study and propose solutions to the challenges we face regarding poverty.

In 2018 we started developing the first component, which focuses on providing children with their daily/educational requirements. Since 2019, we have been testing, learning and redesigning this first piece. Today, SAY is a stable platform supporting Afghan and Iranian children in deprived regions of Iran and is shifting to become a DAO on the Ethereum blockchain to reach millions of children.

Short description:
SAY is a network governed by a community that gathers data from children in poverty and provides them with their daily/educational requirements by leveraging existing NGOs and supply chain infrastructures. 


What is SAY:
SAY enables NGOs and charities to register children on a secure and accessible database and regularly update children's status, daily or educational needs.
 On the other hand, participants in our community get randomly matched to a child's profile that holds a unique avatar representing the child along with their non-fictional short life story and the recorded child's voice SAYing whatever they desire. Users virtually adopt those specific children by choosing roles such as mother, aunt, father, and uncle. These virtual families take care of their children's short and long-term needs through eCommerce links collaboratively or individually. 

How it works:
1- Authorized social workers register children in our app. ( These children are located in NGO/charity/Government camps/Shelters/Orphanages, ...) 
2- Social workers regularly update children's needs from daily requirements such as nutrition to long-term needs such as education.
3- Users use SAY APP to register and search for a random child 
4-After finding the child, users choose a role: mother, father, aunt, uncle, etc., to adopt them virtually and create/join a virtual family.
5- Virtual families use micro-donation to take care of their children's requirements listed by social workers individually or collectively.
(They either buy the product from independent online retailers through our app, like buying a jacket or send their donation directly to NGO, i.e. for school transportation)
6- virtual families receive confirmation receipts/reports at every step to make everything more transparent.

Centralised Flow:


Token Economy:
We are in the R&D stage to create the model and then propose a sustainable token economy. NFT and Governance tokens will be an essential part of our ecosystem.
However, today SAY sustains its ecosystem using donation tips and affiliate marketing commissions from online retailers. (DAO treasury will hold the revenue and will use it to incentivize contributors)




Transparency:
SAY provides up to 4 receipts for every transaction. (bank/e-commerce/NGO/Delivery).
Moreover, we know this is not enough!
Transparency, community incentives, and globalizing SAY are why we are shifting it from a centralized organization to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization on the blockchain.

Why We Applied for Grant:
We have recently started to operate in Canada and building our network and product to collaborate with Canadian NGOs to create virtual families helping local children in the short run. However, we plan to collaborate with organizations operating in all countries to develop an international network of virtual families supporting millions of children in the long run.

stored on IPFS and controlled through Smart Contract. 

There are actually several motivations why Git repositories to Web3 is interesting.
 * At the time of the hackathon, the youtube-dl library has been taken down by Github, something which should be in our opinion impossible to do.
 * Build-in payments in the repositories.
    * Every repository is able to receive donations - no third party required
    * Attach bounties to issues and incentivize the maintainers to fix the issues quickly. If you check out the ipfs/devgrants (https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/projects/1) repository, they have bounties. This is the perfect example to attach cryptos to issues

This is just the beginning and web3 opens up way more possibilities.

898,genie-online-gaming-meets-blockchain,"Genie is a reward platform for no-loss challenges for online games

With genie you can make a challenge on top of any game that exposes an API, and invite your friends and rivals to take part. To join you stake DAI, and while you are playing the staked funds generate the reward from the accrued interest, using the Compound protocol. We use Chainlink oracles to determine the winner that will receive the prize, while everyone can have their stake back.

Built with love fun during Hack Money 2020 (best Chainlink project!) and Funding the Future hackaton (best DeFi usage for games). We want to bridge the universes of crypto and gamers, bringing mass adoption to the former and new, impossible before functionality to the gaming world.

Genie's core values

Low barrier entry
Everyone should be able to use the genie! Joining a challenge needs to be easy as possible to reach the inpatient gamer audience. We fear they are going to break their keyboard while waiting to that transaction to confirm 🤣 . Currently we are finishing the integration with GSN to fund user transactions, while in the future we plan to introduce on/off ramp services and burner wallets. → barrier entry = ability to launch your video game.

Decentralization
First of all, staking your money is should be safe! (we do need a proper audit). The users interact with a pool contract that is responsible for holding funds and managing the withdraws, performing reward generation and distribution.
The winner selection is done by a third-party Chainlink node operators. This makes it trust-less from the genie team in terms of access to funds and development. Thus: 1. We can't manipulate the winner. 2. If you want to integrate a new game into genie, you need to build your own Chainlink adapter that will select the winner and plug it into the pool contract. That's the adapter we built for Path of Exile ⚔️.

Fun
Do you also got sense that Ethereum got too much Defied? There's a lot of innovation! but it seems like everyone is trying to build the next DEX, AMM, yield hack, and name-your-next-money-protocol-thing. We are about to take the DeFi tech and make a fun usage of it! We are saying No to traders and Yes to the average gamer Jane and Joe.

What we got till now?

We got an MVP. No, what I wanted to say is we got an MVP 🎉 !!!
Opening our DApp you can create your own challenge (wizard is pretty nice you should check it out 🙂) or join the existing one. We run on Kovan test network so feel free to try, there's also ETH and DAI faucets in case you're low on balance 😉. It works the way I described above but with a couple hacks to deliver it on time.
We did an integration with Path of Exile - free online action RPG game set in a dark fantasy world 🌓. More game integrations are in mind, but now we are focused on the Proof of Concept with the PoE community.

How we got till now?

The idea was conceived and introduced on the Pitch Day for the Funding The Future hack on March 17, 9 AM EST time (yes I checked the calendar event). I pitched it for the first time to a bunch of hackers (Connor and Vitek were there👋) and surprisingly, got very positive feedback 😅. This gave me fuel to start building and eventually winning the first prize bounty, then entering Hack Money 2020 right away, assembling the team, and after another month of building, nearly presenting to Vitalik (then not presenting), and at the end winning the sponsor prize for the best Chainlink integration. Oh what a ride (where's my lambo?).

Other ways to help

Cryptoz is very much a passion project that has allowed our very very small team of developers to bring some very much loved original assets on to the blockchain and develop a unique and interesting NFT collector dynamic. Our team members each have jobs to keep the lights on, and are seeking community support to relieve some of these pressures to allow us more opportunity to improve the Cryptoz Dapp. We have lots of ideas of how we can really expand this community by creating tools and data views that will really enrich the experience.

491,tokamak-network-decentralized-scalable-turing-com,"The problem Tokamak network is trying to solve is the current constraints of the Ethereum blockchain including scalability, high transaction fees, lack of functionality, and privacy. It is crucial to solve this problem because due to these constraints, current Dapps can only provide limited services and it is impossible for traditional IT services to utilize blockchain technology. Moreover, new technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, cannot be implemented under current conditions and other Plasma chains.

Tokamak network offers a powerful tool for the builders to utilize the full potential of Ethereum blockchain without sacrificing decentralization.

The Ethereum Foundation grantee Tokamak Network is a protocol that allows anyone to easily create a plasma chain that ensures scalability and security. It is a plasma that fully supports EVM and is 100% compatible with Ethereum smart contracts. Unlike other plasma chains that only provides limited features such as token transfers, Dapps running on Ethereum can seamlessly migrate to Tokamak plasma right away. We’ve been developing generalized plasma from 2018, and we have made transferring assets between Ethereum and plasma more secure and convenient.

The security of the Tokamak network is ensured by the rootchain contract. In addition, through the rootchain contract, ERC20 token and Requestable Token, a new type of token for Tokamak, can enter into and exit from the Tokamak plasma chain without limitation, to Ethereum Mainnet.

Another feature that is provided in Tokamak Network is fee delegation. By using Stamina, users can send transactions without consuming their assets as gas fees. Fees are deducted from delegated stamina in the Tokamak plasma chain. 

With Tokamak Network’s computational capacity, now it is possible to implement privacy solutions in an economically viable way. Until now, ZKP could not be used in Ethereum main chain due to performance and Tx fee issues. As an MVP, we are currently developing a zk-DEX(Private decentralized exchange), decentralized exchanges that guarantee the traders’ privacy, which is a powerful application of ZKP that operates on top of Tokamak Network. The first step of establishing this privacy ecosystem is to adopt “zk-DAI” into the network by migrating makerDAO’s smart contract, so now Tokamak Network has a partnership with MakerDAO.

375,sense-collective-collaborative-sensemaking-and-co,"

Many dystopic utopian sci-fi novels (and actual historic regimes) have started out with the intention of making society “legible” from the perspective of the State, in order to enact some plan that will certainly tame the complexities of civil planning once and for all. This typically doesn’t end well…

The problem is not in making society legible, this turns out to be an incredibly effective way of gaining insight into the workings of our complex adaptive systems. 

High fidelity models of reality are a key layer of building effective collaborative sensemaking and collective intelligence systems. 




Sense Collective Multi-Agent Modeling Workflow

Software companies that have figured this out, and proceeded to take advantage of the inevitable information asymmetry that they've been able to grow wider and wider in the last decade are about to run out of coal for their money making machines as we realize that we are making high-fidelity models of reality everyday. We are mapping every corner of the world, with our photos, our words, our sentiment, the network graphs of our interactions. 

The problems set-in when such amazingly accurate models are designed as centralized systems, with intermediaries and rent-seekers, and all manners by which to exploit and extract the value of information, personal data and insights flowing through what is ultimately a legibility machine. 

James C. Scott’s fascinating and seminal book, [Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300078153?ie=UTF8&tag=ribbonfarmcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0300078153), examines how, across dozens of domains, ranging from agriculture and forestry, to urban planning and census-taking, a very predictable failure pattern keeps recurring. We end up with “Scientific Forestry” and the fragility of these highly legible systems can’t possibly manage the beautiful chaos of reality.




Simplified views of reality tend to discount vital insights that aren’t part of the lossy-compressed model.

The continuing evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem has reached a point where a different type of legibility is now possible. A bottom-up, and fractal approach to building legibility into the richness of our personal identities, protected by self-sovereign identity tools that encode each of our unique preferences, goals, constraints and agreements into the transactions that ultimately make reality legible.

The Ethereum ecosystem serves as a substrate upon which to build:

Legibility machines created from personal and collaborative data, but owned by the contributors, with granular rights on a per-person basis.
Intention Engines that give this granular preference management capability to technical and non-technical people alike.
Context Brokers to help coordinate between human and machine agents as we transition from the sharecropping legibility factory were we tend our digital plots unwitingly bringing about a weaking of our coordination systems, to the decentralized web where we can calibrate these interactions across a galaxy of cooperatively owned nodes. 

Sense Collective's tools and protocols are designed to support this vision through open-source contributions to the collaborative commons. This includes:
a language workbench, educational programming and workshops to support various types of knowledge work and social impact efforts of businesses, ngo's, and the individual and collective action of people and their local municipal agencies.



Installation of community-owned sensor and IOT networks
Using Friend of A Friend ontology to create social graphs and knowledge graphs that follow the metamodel approach outlined by ox shards and off chain state channels. 

Our vision is to create a domain specific modeling ecosystem that brings together concepts from the toxentaxonomyinitiative, cr8's Dynamic Token EIP and combinations of elements of several EIP's to deliver an off-chain ecosystem for multi-agent modeling, taxonomy, ontology and schema design that maps to the formalization of token taxonomies that are appropriate to the type of token value flow ontology. With the dynamic token layering that Ocean Protocol outlines in a number of posts, we see a concept map that looks something like this:




In this way, it is possible to maintain the amended state of agents and tokens

Creation of hybrid DEFi instruments, DAO’s, TCR’s and other smart contracts and token engineering that ultimately give way to a collaborative sensemaking and collective intelligence substrate where the collaborative commons, decentralized web, and hybrid capital markets represent the interests and alignment of the stakeholders who create this ecosystem and the public commons it is designed to support.

As the Ethereum ecosystem matures, the role of token engineering can be viewed outside of pure economics and viewed from the perspective of biological systems. From this perspective, it becomes easier to reason about the growing number of distinct token types as part of regulatory systems.

Token engineering can then be evaluated as a doctor might review the blood sugar and metabolic system to determine if someone where a diabetic. 

This nuance within token engineering was not immediately clear with the layer 1 and layer 2 protocols, but has become clearer, especially within the Ethereum ecosystem, with the nuanced design of dynamic NFT tokens, and hybrid combinations and wrapping/unwrapping through specific use-cases. 

The role of cryptoeconomics and the transformative power of cryptoeconomic primatives to shape new business models and build entirely new tools for coordinating socio-economic and socio-technical systems, this results in the dynamic interaction of multiple token types that represent different regulatory systems for reputation, identity, impact, equity, and fiat interactions. 

Project-Based Field Testing

As co-founder of Sense Collective, i have been working to identify the optimal combination of token protocols within a number of related use-cases that all deal with the same general ontologies and themes; the coordination of shared resources within the context of social and natural capital management. 

This has positioned me and the other co-founders of Sense Collective to work with a number of different projects in the last 2 years, including a genomics company doing personalized cancer drug discovery(My Personal Therapeutics), a skincare and wellness knowledge discovery and data collective (Curapersona) a line of Skincare products designed around self-sovereign identity and personal/protected data (Adepeau), and the ongoing work to break down the silos between the 200+ NGO's that i've been working with for over 10 years with a focus on ecosystem services, ecological restoration and environmental education. Our ongoing workshops and field programs aim to connect as many projects to real-world use-cases as possible. 

The ""crypto winter"" has been quite effective in speeding along the market's natural convergence around token economics that can maintain the value flow of their intended market, outside of a wildly speculative energy. As projects like Gauntlet, Blockscience, have shown, this doesn't happen by sheer luck, but is rather the result of careful token engineering and can ultimately be modeled and sandboxed, to at least realize a ballpark understanding of what a token will do under a range of simulated conditions. 

Particularly within Sense Collective's area of focus, (social and natural capital) this has sped up certain fundamentals that will likely form the basis of the emerging knowledge supply chain and all utility tokens that intend to provide or enrich the value of social impact & public benefit activities. 

My work with Sense Collective has focused on an approach to token engineering, from the perspective of multi-agent modeling. Our main focus has been in designing:

a language workbench for translating natural language business processes into Riccardian contracts that can then be compiled into Smart Contracts
Personal identity management tools for expressing the goals, intentions, risk tolerance and other preferences of individuals, which can then be compiled into Riccardian contracts and compiled into smart contracts.
Community-driven Interactive Design with the Perceptagon Toolkit which includes sensor/iot/environmental monitoring/displays installed as public art and connected to the business process modeling and personal identity management tools. 

Additional Research Concepts we are exploring (and we need your help!):

Re: Extralegal Enforcement of property rights, and other value streams that bump up against the current legal system.

The simplest of all somatic governance paradigms, namely control of a simple jointed limb by a single flexor muscle. They found that it is impossible to determine forces from limb positions- therefore, the problem cannot have a pre-computed (feedforward) mathematical solution. Instead, a top-down command bias signal changes the threshold feedback level in the sensorimotor loop, eg the loop formed by the afferent and efferent nerves, thus changing the so-called ‘equilibrium point’ of the flexor muscle/ elbow joint system. An overview of the arrangement reveals that global postures and limb position are commanded in feedforward terms, using global displacements (common coding), with the forces needed being computed locally by feedback loops. This method of sensorimotor unit governance, which is based upon what Anatol Feldman calls the ‘equilibrium Point’ theory, is formally equivalent to a servomechanism such as a car’s ‘cruise control’

When reviewing the extralegal characteristics of Oracles, Off-chain enforcement of smart contracts, as in the case of the more advanced use-cases for Mattereum, instead of attempting to pre-compute all the possible states for enforcement of smart contracts associated to breach of contract, we can model the equilibrium points from the AI & Robotics field, that treat the extralegal context as the variable limb position. This approach is potentially applicable where there cannot be a global precomputed solution, but instead a dynamic relationship between conditions, and stakeholders who provide feedback to a local context broker that is given certain signing capabilities that are triggered by a combination of human and machine agents. 

Sense Collective is interested in exploring concepts from various bonding curve implementations that adjust the ratio between human and machine agents acting as oracles or enforcement agents.

Our explorations into Blackboard Agent Modeling are also worth exploring in a working-group setting, 

This grant application has already gone well beyond the average length of submissions. I hope I have conveyed my deep passion and commitment to advancing the state of the art within the Ethereum ecosystem. 
Sense Collective has begun submitting several more formal grants to over a dozen different projects within the Ethereum ecosystem including:

FOAM
Ocean Protocol
Decentraland
Colony.io
We are preparing a grant request to launch a DAO with MetaCartel
I have prepared several ideas for adding value to the MetaGame MMPOG as well as to MetaFactory to bring my experience from the music industry into these areas. 

With the changing tides and fast-paced development of the blockchain space, it is sometimes hard to find one's place. The launch of the Gitcoin grant and platform has given me such great inspiration, as it espouses the core ideals that we have attempted to bake into Sense Collective's work as well. 

The introduction of the Ocean Protocol, and the concepts currently being developed by Mattereum, to build a global object registry and library of digital twin models of objects, is the perfect opportunity to begin the work that is critical to ensuring that we successfully steer the course of our socio-technical and socio-economic future towards a destination where we are collaborating and coordinating to define our increasingly automated hyper-reality in a way that gives us agency and reflexivity. Putting skin in the game via staking of reputation and fungible tokens, to anchor the validity of records, collaborating in defining the Token Taxonomies that will ultimately act as carrier waves as we build out the emergent knowledge supply chain.

The Gitcoin Grant program is an expression of a new type of public goods funding that is essential to providing the seed capital needed to build out the various layers of the knowledge supply chain, not as an extractive business model, but as a collaborative commons. Creative funding is an essential layer if we want to ensure that the extractive surveillance marketplace model is removed, before every last ounce of value is sucked from the marrow of our creative commons.

Sense Collective would be honored to join the ranks of projects that you support in building out this ecosystem.

Part1: Why Sense Collective?

Gitcoin Grants will support the continued development of Sense Collective's Social Impact Toolkit and Social Computing SDK which includes:

An open source collection of templates, IOT sketches for Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and educational programs and workshops that help NGO's, businesses, schools, municipalities and citizens to convert their existing social impact efforts and agreements into smart contracts and token taxonomies that form a foundation for collaborative sensemaking and collective intelligence. Sense Collective was created in collaboration with The Rock 'n Renew Foundation to support the technology and systems engineering needs of several massive public health and educational programs with The NRDC, 350.org, The Sierra Club & Campus Climate Challenge.

Sense Collective's first hardware/software toolkit, The Perceptagon, designed to improve the coordination and aggregation of best practices and lesson plans for over 200 school garden programs in 18 cities. Rock 'n Renew's community & school garden initiative, while successful, was hitting a ceiling in it's ability to scale beyond a certain point. Every year, the cycle of training and onboarding students and teachers would start as if we hardly did anything the year before. The interaction between schools, sharing of best practices, and methods, was incredibly difficult to replicate. 

We have begun to generate NFT ""trading cards"" of design patterns that line up to tokenized versions of each plant/fruit/vegetable.
We are actively pursuing grants from both blockchain and traditional NGO Foundations and Public Funding sources, to scale out the program to include the integration of VR/AR/XR design to create representations of native plants, invasive plants, ecosystem services, and other aspects of the ecological restoration work that we do, which includes ecosystem service modeling using the ARIES platform and other multi-agent modeling software. 
We are actively looking for help to connect these efforts to FOAM, to add in their hardware requirements to make each Perceptagon a POI and GIS node in their TCR ecosystem.
To layer the real-world POI to virtual locations inside Decentraland, Cryotovoxels, MetaGame, and with much community and developer support, to build out plug-ins to add in an ecosystem services provision layer to Mattereum, Ocean Protocol, and using our Unity plug-in model, to create an incentivized ecosystem upon which to connect our Social Impact Bond DEFI financing and incentivization model. 

That's a pretty ambitious checklist for our roadmap. As far as financing these efforts, I can think of no better way then a hybrid collection of DEFI products, undercollateralized loans, grants, NFT sales, anything but an ICO, only funding streams that consistently support the token economics that are emerging around these first order principals. DAO's across the board to map the governance models that suit each context best. Our position on DAO's is to launch them within existing communities to strengthen these communities in an anti-rivalrous way. 

 this round, to let us know we are on the right path, and your feedback on some of these specific ideas would be unvaluable. I will break each one out into a post on the wall, and begin creating github issues as well. 
Any suggestions on how to clean up this marathon post will be taken to heart as well. Also, sharing to your network to get a few small contributions goes a long way, as you know. 

Whats Next?

The next weekly educational workshop is on Friday, January 24th, streamed live on Zoom and Youtube, the address is on our website. 
Several in-person meetups, mini-hackathons and coordination sessions that connect to our ongoing demonstration projects that we hope to weave together with multiple projects from within the Gitcoin community. 
In the spirit of Doug Englebardt’s Network Improvement Communities, Sense Collective will help to coordinate and weave together as many projects from within the Gitcoin community as possible to create a Gitcoin-powered Decentralized Network Improvement Alliance.

Upcoming Workshop Topics:

Game Design & Gamification: A 2 part workshop. Part 1 will include a hands-on look at the role of games and of gamification with the context of the emerging public commons. The Metaverse Changes Everything! Exploration of various concepts applicable to Sense Collective’s Data Collective workflow. How do NFT’s and immersive games shape the experience of collaborative sensemaking? We will touch on Minecraft For Good, AI For Good.
CapacitorDAO: Bootstrapping a DEFI Social Impact Bond for the Semantic Blockchain
Perceptagon IOT/Sensor/Peripheral Kit for Cyber-Physical Interactive Design
We will introduce the Perceptagon Installation Art series and explore the design of new NFT’s for bridging the physical/digital realities between sensor nodes and in-game experiences.

The Future Of Work & Finance
A look at the concepts being developed in the Defi space, and the role of hybrid financing models in public funding and public/private partnerships focusing on Social Impact. Beyond the ICO, The Gitcoin Grant Model is an amazing example of the alternative funding methods that are needed to radically advance our collaborative sensemaking and collective intelligence capabilities.
Digital Twins & The Global Object Registry: We will look at the Mattereum projects amazing roadmap for building out a global ecosystem for registering objects, and their associated meta-data within a hybrid TCR model that we think will help solve many issues around the realization of trust and the validity of information within the emerging knowledge supply chain. Each of Sense Collective’s projects will include the creation of small TopicTCR’s that use Ocean Protocol and Mattereum’s data model as a foundation for our Semantic Web blockchain registry for taxonomy, schema and ontology information.

We aspire to create a modular online course to help new blockchain developers understand the principles and best practices of data science. Using open data sources from across the Ethereum landscape (think StateoftheDApps, UniSwap, & Etherscan), the course will teach the topics of data munging, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and dabble in a bit of deep learning and artificial intelligence. As the course grows, we intend to create case studies around how to apply data science to specific DApps (think machine learning techniques for predicting markets with Numer.ai data or analyzing traits in CryptoKitties).

Our ultimate vision is to spur and inspire the next generation of developers through interesting applications of data science to emerging blockchain technologies.

Updates

Gitcoin Grant Round 8

Like everything else in the world, 2020 flipped our course development plans upside down. Instead of building the course from the bottom up, we chose to repurpose and refactor our Medalla research into motivating case studies on how to perform data analysis on Ethereum 2.0 blockchain data. The case studies walk through, in detail, how we performed the analysis that ultimately netted us a bronze prize. We also included a tutorial on how to use R Shiny as an exploration tool for understanding the Numer.ai dApp's tournament data.

📝 Change log
Restructured the repository for clarity
Added 3 case studies

Gitcoin Grants Round 9

For Round 9 we've doubled down on our ""case study first"" approach to teaching data science using projects on the Ethereum blockchain as examples. This update includes a look at NFTs, stable coins, market capitalization estimation, and an introduction to GraphQL. We expanded two of our original case studies to include Python version, so if you are interested in learning more about that language you can check those out here and here. This update also includes our first attempt at creating video lectures for the eager learners who would like to dive deeper into the concepts. We intend to use funding from this round to further expand the set of case studies we produce and improve the quality of our video content.

FAQ

Do you all have experience in this stuff?
Why yes, we do! Omni Analytics Group is a team of PhD level statistical consultants that have been teaching and solving difficult data science problems for nearly a decade. We are passionate about data science and blockchain technologies. Just check out our twitter.

Do I need any prior experience before taking this course?
Our intention is to start from the beginning and build up not only your data chops, but your statistical intuition and programming knowledge. At the end of these courses, you should be able to match a statistical technique to a blockchain data problem, write a basic script to analyze it and confidently search online for more advanced knowledge.

What programming languages will the course focus on?
We'll initially focus on the statistical language R, but then expand to Python. As the course grows, we hope to include examples with contracts written in Solidity.

Can I request a topic?
Sure! Once we flesh out the initial course material. If funding persists, we'd be more than happy to take suggestions on case studies or topics.

2099,coure-coin,"Couré Coin (collateralized objective utility reserve) 

The 9000 lines of code that forged the first World Wide Web will be auctioned off as an NFT this month. How ironic that these same 9000 lines of code eventually gave us cryptocurrency, algorithmic stablecoins, and NFTs. It's the whole reason you are reading this right now. 

""Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web, will sell the source code that made the first web browser work. The code–9,000 lines of it–will be sold as an NFT, or nonfungible token, in a Sotheby’s auction later this month. Berners-Lee’s NFT will get “the original time-stamped files containing the source code for the world wide web, digitally signed by Sir Tim,” Sotheby’s states in a release. “These are the list of commands he masterminded . . . the bare bones from which the web was born . . .” The NFT also contains a digital poster featuring the whole 9,000 lines of code, and a letter from Berners-Lee about the creation of the World Wide Web."" - Fastcompany  (01, June 2021)

Welcome to the stablecoin future. Couré is the first lunar minted, Algorithmic Micro-fractional UBI Stablecoin. Couré stands for ""collateralized objective utility reserve"". Couré is a fractional UBI stablecoin that utilizes a fractional reserve algorithm. Couré is a boutique designer stablecoin created for limited token supply. As a designer token protocol, it fulfills a niche demand, network-fit. Couré is based on a 5-year token design thesis inspired by Ethereum MakerDAO, Zcash, and Monero. Couré coin is a decentralized, staked consensus algorithmic protocol.

Why are stablecoins on the rise ?

Couré design foresees NFTs, social and governing tokens as the killer cryptocurrency application. Stablecoins are the solution to the challenge of cryptocurrency adoption. But more importantly, stablecoins that leverage layer 2 (eth 2.0) are set to drive NFTs, social tokens, governing tokens, and gaming. NFTs have made their way into art-house such as Christie's.  Stablecoins are prime to become the leading cryptocurrency of art, media, and entertainment. 

Why algorithmic stablecoins ?

Algorithmic stable coins can hold their positions and withstand economic shocks unlike other families of stablecoins. Here is an article the makes things clear and simple. It gives a visualization of how algorithmic stablecoins work. And why they are the future of cryptoeconomics. A visual explanation of algorithmic stablecoins. 

What is instore for stablecoins in 2022 ?

Post-Covid global economics and its effect on life, family, business, and technology have forever reshaped the global cultural landscape. Impacting how the world grows forward. This world awaking process is still underway which gives us reason to see with a dual design consciousness. There are very few parts of the world that have not been drastically affected. Stablecoin protocols will be the core cryptocurrency on-ramps for retail, art, entertainment, and social impact. Stablecoins are the future of cryptocurrency monetary policy. They signify the constant evolution of digital assets.

1ST OFF THIS IS AMAZING AND I CAN NOT BELIEVE THE SUPPORT WE HAVE HAD THROUGH OUR PROJECT SO FAR...❤️❤️❤️

The formation of the Ethereal Art Museum NFT DAO ! 🌈👽🚀

Why a DAO ? (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
We have a few different community related initiatives to help assist artists who need help exposing their message with the world.
A set of rules to help guide the stake holders of our governance system to vote on each implementation as we grow together.
Providing clear transparency across the board to each person involved with our project using a multi signature wallet.
Each board member of the DAO must come to unanimous decisions for every cause.

The utilization of a DAO framework helps us establish a large network of support from all around the world.

THE TECHNOLOGY
Using a combination of Augmented Reality & Virtual Reality to display artwork improves the capability to interact with anyone, anywhere. Breaking down the limitations of a real world work environment. XR also known as Cross Reality types of experiences can make a major impact on the subject who is immersed within the virtual realm.

AUGMENTED REALITY ART GALLERY
This is a way to create incentives that bring real world use case and utility to blockchain technology. Helping bridge the gap between the 2D & 3D world. A portal into our exclusive METAVERSE experience based on physical locations such as Red Rocks Park & Amphitheater located here in Colorado. A live music venue with an endless amount of possibilities to collaborate with musicians and artists from all around the world. Our goal is to use this specific location to expose the general public to NFT art and more educational information about cryptocurrency. The potential is huge! 

TEAM SUPERWORLD
We will be using Augmented Reality on the SUPERWORLD APP. 
This land parcel gives us the ability to sell NFT art from a specific Geographic location.

Something really cool about Superworld is that with each purchase of a plot 1 tree is planted through the ONE TREE PLANTED non-profit organization helping to combat global deforestation against for profit corporations. Together we can create a better world !

Let's create a new generation of creators.
We are here to help educate other artists with our creative process !!! 

Our main goal is to help onboard other artists into the NFT space & contribute to our artists in Peru who are teaching the youth traditional painting techniques.

Alicia is a 2D artist who has started her journey into the 3D art world with a new iPad for digital painting and sketching. Together we are partners in creation and love to collaborate on art projects. The support we receive through this grant will help us become more independent and allow us to have ample time for our own creation process.

What is Fractal Visions ?
Fractal Visions is a supernatural group of artists creating visions and contributing towards the art formed for mutual benefit. A real world physical & digital assets marketplace where art collectors can choose Limited Edition tokenized artwork from a gallery of artists gathered from around the world. The NFTs represent ownership of art and authenticity of the image.

What makes Fractal Visions extra special ?
There are already art gallery services that can compare to our site, but we offer exclusive visionary art from international artists you can not find anywhere else in the decentralized marketplace. We want to bridge the gap between the digital & physical art world by creating a completely decentralized online market for NFT art. As well as providing PHYSICAL NFT for sale creating a real world asset that will never loose value.

Our Mission Statement
Support our mission. We help build a strong foundation for each artist to continue creating their work. Every archival printed product is made locally here in Fort Collins, Colorado and shipped directly to the customer. 
We help each of our featured artists with the costs of minting their artwork. Waving these fees for those who are less fortunate can provide a life changing opportunity through the sale of NFTs.

Our Long Term Vision
Clairvoyant Alliance consists of a vision shared with other artists in the community. Creating a unique opportunity for those who wish to share the message behind their artwork. Together we share our visions with others.

How do we plan on evolving in the future ?

In the near future our governance Token will be used within the DAO community driven projects to help other artists throughout the world. 
Expected launch for the Ethereal Art Museum DAO is yet to be announced !

We create real world assets! Currently we are in the process of our official NFT market launch. Including Physical NFT tokens with augmented reality.

The project implements an incentivized protocol called Ants-Review that rewards scientists for peer-reviewing other scientists’ work and that builds up trust and reputation. 

DESIGN

An incentivization mechanism built on Ethereum in which bounties for open access peer-reviews can be issued and rewarded in reputation scores and digital currency by the scientific community while preserving both the accountability of the contributors and their anonymity. The best peer reviews will be ranked through a voting system.



PROTOCOL

We designed a protocol of smart contracts that allows authors to issue a bounty for peer reviews linked to requirements stored on IPFS which reviewers can fulfill by submitting the IPFS hash containing their review.




FUTURE PLANS

We are planning to extend the prototype through R&D to build a DAO to govern the protocol via gamified incentives. To promote ethical behavior and transparency, peer reviews are open access but the identity of the reviewers will remain hidden and the transactions private through encryption.

Read our latest update

Trust is a graphic novel and animated motion comic that tells the story of a young Kenyan woman who learns about blockchain and uses it to transform her community. The goal of the project is to grow the global blockchain community in the locations where people’s lives will be most transformed by the impact. By telling a story that is culturally relevant, we can help our readers see a future that is free from the issues they experience in their daily lives, while also providing them with the tools to create that future. The book will directly cover the basics, but it will also link to local blockchain education providers to help readers take the next step to becoming crypto users, entrepreneurs, and developers. We want to inspire the next generation of Africans to build with blockchain and be an integral part of the community.

We believe that the best way to build the best blockchain ecosystem possible and grow the community is to increase the number and the diversity of people building it. To achieve this, we will distribute an open-access, mobile-first digital version through key partnerships with tech and education networks.

Our goal is to reach over 1 million African youth.

The team includes graphic novelist and storyteller Chief Nyamweya of Kenya, and blockchain educator and investor, Anne Connelly of Canada. To date, we have created the first chapter, mapped out the characters and storyline, secured a publisher and begun making key partnerships in the space to support the distribution of the book.

Trust is supported by Interchain Foundation, Algorand Foundation, Consensys Grants, Cardano Foundation, Conflux Network, and Africalia. Funding will support the artist's salary, partnership development, and the creation of the digital booksite.

2164,rarepizzascom,"🍕 Calling All Pizzanauts!

A spectre is haunting Earth--the spectre of hunger. All the powers of the old world have failed to confront hunger at scale: Bill Gates, Soylent Green, Nations, Presidents and dictators alike. Scarcity runs rampant in the world today, but we have the power to turn digital scarcity into analog aplenty.

The goal of the RarePizzas.com, most simply put, is to buy 10,000+ pizzas for people who like to eat pizza.  The formation of the RarePizzas.com is the participatory and semi-serious approach to a fundamental human problem: sometimes it’s hard to get enough to eat. The Pizza Mafia is a motley crew of artists, techies, ninja turtles, and pizza lovers from all walks of life and all around the world engaged in a social experiment to harness the raw awesome power of decentralization to help our pizza pals all over the world.

📃 Recipe

As a way to give back to their community, this group of paisanos has come up with the idea to use blockchain technology to create an economy which; as a natural consequence of its normal operation, generates pizza.  By harnessing the creative power of hundreds of amazing artists from the blockchain community, we are creating digital art (NFTs) to be randomly generated and distributed to collectors around the world.  On May 22nd, 2021 RarePizzas.com will fund the delivery of 10,000 delicious pizzas through a distributed network of partner pizza shops around the world in honor of Laszlo's Bitcoin Pizza Day

🛒 Ingredients

Contributions will support operations of RarePizzas.com to promote pizza knowledge, access, and awareness globally and demonstrate a blueprint for how creative groups can self-organize to solve real world problems, or even just pursue common goals.  RarePizzas.com is an evolving entity, but we share some common beliefs.
- We believe markets can be positive sum and can enrich communities
- We believe artists are important members of our community
- we believe anyone should be allowed to help others without asking for permission
- We believe memes are powerful vessels for raising awareness
- We believe in equal inclusion of all pizza toppings (yes, even pineapple)

🧑‍🍳 Aspiring Pizzaioli

RarePizzas.com is a creative project and is evolving all the time.  We need your help to fulfill our vision of bringing pizza to those in need.  There are many ways to participate, and the best way to get involved is to visit rarepizzas.com and join the discussion on Discord.

1142,seedbank,"Wikipedia for 3D Objects. See website www.seedb4nk.org for visual aids and description. 

The mission of Seedbank is to collect, catalogue, distribute, and maintain (provably) the world's most comprehensive collection of digital 3D assets, containing any and all primary representations for objects, beings, or things that comprise observable reality. The collection will be known as the COMPENDIUM, a depository and backup of physical reality as seen and observed on and from Earth, offering truly disruptive access to 3D models for next-to-nothing costs (1/1000th of current paradigm levels) affordable to all, yet available in versions for even the most demanding of applications.

To seed the COMPENDIUM, individuals submit their models for consideration, side by side with other ""seeders,"" then others in the seedbank community pick the best representation of the real thing - i.e. the seed of the 3D model that will be planted, so to speak. This selection process accomplishes two key goals:
   1) Consensus taste-driven decision-making for approving or declining COMPENDIUM entries; and
   2) Attachment of buying power, voting power, and file share responsibility - another way of saying ""voting for an entry"" is ""investing in the right to share a portion of a model once it is approved"" - if an entry is not selected, those who spent WATER receive SUN as a consolation (this mechanism is TBD)

The three actors are seeders, planters, and harvesters. These actors are not mutually exclusive; it is our hope and expectation that members of our community will operate in multiple roles throughout the COMPENDIUM as illustrated in our website. Perhaps a more fitting definition would be that any user providing inputs or taking outputs can be considered an actor, and the available actions correspond to a COMPENDIUM’s current persona representing [0],[1], or [2]. The important aspect is that users (actors) can interact as all three personas in any sort of imaginable spectrum between creator and consumer.

Versions can be released in a phased manner to expand COMPENDIUM fields based on community requests or needs AND, with each version, to increase the minimum resolution (polygon count) for all models listed on the database. Raising the bar for resolution with each version release ensures contributors always have fields to fill, creates a model hierarchy and allows for people to only access versions of the COMPENDIUM they can afford OR have a need for (for example, a storyboard artist may have all of their basic needs met with COMPENDIUM 1.0 files, whereas 2.0 or 3.0 might be better suited for a surfacing designer or animator), and the differentiation of versions correlates the value of our primary token to a metric (polygon count) with no theoretical limit THROUGH THE LENS of human taste or aesthetics. So each new version stimulates the economy and could be an opportunity to mediate the economy through changing reward levels version to version.

While our competitors put up insurmountable paywalls and hoard freedom of expression, our DApp is unique because we are not financial in nature, and the DApps that are similar to ours (thematically) lack broader unifying visions OR repackage archaic and greedy business models. Certain internet 2.0 competitors tout themselves as marketplaces for rare digital art (both 2D and 3D) and their main pitch is that blockchain proves your ownership. DID SEAN PARKER CHANGE THE WORLD FOREVER BY PROVING THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY OWNED THEIR CDs? No, he f!@#ing made Napster. Unless the ""digital farmscapes"" they are selling for~$900 on certain galleries begin producing literal farm goods for us to print and sell somehow, they can take their precious ""rare"" art and put it in a closet in an abandoned subway station - as more people might see or care about it there. By all odds, the digital art from these sites will only depreciate in value with time. This is as far from ""public good"" as one can stray - overcharging single-case early adopters for something placed behind a pay wall and therefore deemed rare. Hypocrites.

Our project will certainly perform a public good by creating multiple revenue streams for the community, offering educational resources at fractional costs, and undertaking a lofty goal to codify the forms seen on and from Earth. Certainly, this extremely important endeavor could become a non-profit which we would support, but we can investigate our options as the vision becomes more clear and the model suggests it can stand on its own two legs. In any event, the GitCoin grant session we are pursuing is specifically for projects concerning ""public good.""No one else seems poised to accomplish something of this scale that could augment education and also preserve assets for all of humanity. In contrast to others, we can create income streams in multiple ways for our participants, and in a very real and inartificial way wrap them in a metaphor people can understand, relate to and want to forage with. 

Let’s get in front of open and creative people who are clamoring for an interesting DApp to come around that also creates a “public asset” and preserves it for humanity. Let's get people excited about life again, about the beauty of the Earth. Let's ensure the base model is a given for the next generation of creatives, artists and engineers and their ideas don't perish climbing a paywall. Let's collect the seeds we will use to plant and supplant reality - where world building itself could become a part of a stack. If life on Earth were to face damning threats, whether external ones like asteroid impacts or internal ones like total nuclear war, the COMPENDIUM could be exported, stored or sent out into space at any time. All of the proof of the wonders of life and its evolutions that this planet witnessed, the toilings of millenia, preserved on a single chain.
 
Sincerely,
Druid, Shaman, & Paladin

Update 9/15: We aim to provide a github link soon with loose contract structures and descriptions of mechanisms as they pertain to fungibility vs non amongst SEED, WATER, and SUN. SUN becomes WATER over time. SUN regulates voting and provides losing investors with additional skin in the game. WATER flows as voting power and buying power. SEED is scattered amongst investors like a p2p file share network. Harvesters (outside consumers) use WATER to get access to portions of the 3D models, therefore making a Planters investment worthwhile over time. Seeders are always given the largest stake of a SEED, and therefore accrue the most WATER. We do not pretend to know the feasibility of such a system entirely, but know the bones are good and would rely on the community to help us build. Invest in ideas, they said. We got the juice - our team needs you!

Our work is organized around three core principles — you can read more in our manifesto here:
1) Technology is part of a system.
2) Technologists should also be thinkers, writers, and advocates. 
3) Optimism is an action, not a belief.

We're seeking your support to help us expand our educational and editorial work around the sociology, philosophy, and politics of web3.

⚡️WHY WEB3? ⚡️

We see web3 as a unique arena where it's possible to align sociopolitical and technological transformation. 

Yet there's a lack of accessible, accurate, and balanced information on the impact of crypto on society. This inaccessibility, combined with the emphasis on crypto as a speculative asset class, discourages many people — including policymakers, activists, and communities currently underserved by technology — from helping shape its future.

Our web3 work has three primary goals:
1) Increase the diversity of participants and perspectives in web3 
2) Produce nuanced analysis in a media ecosystem dominated by extreme hype and criticism 
3) Facilitate public deliberation on web3's role in sustainable, systems-level change

Reboot has published several pieces about web3, including ""No More Starving Artists,"" ""The Creator's Dilemma,"" an interview with gubsheep of Dark Forest, and two pieces in our magazine Kernel. We've also hosted an internal book club on Glen Weyl and Eric Posner's Radical Markets, a public event with Camila Russo on The Infinite Machine, and an upcoming event with Professor Finn Brunton on Digital Cash.

We're currently producing an essay and seminar series around the theme of “Crypto for the Public” with a group of web3 builders and web3 newbies from other fields. Rather than focusing on ""onboarding the next billion users,"" as if web3 is another app to get hooked on, these essays examine what happens when this new technology collides with existing societies and structures.

⚡️WHY THIS MATTERS ⚡️

The web3 revolution puts the internet at a crossroads.

We have an opportunity to build an internet free from platform exploitation: where people have ownership and control over their own data, where communities can architect infrastructures and governance systems based on their values, where arbitrary borders can’t impinge economic freedom.

But this future is far from guaranteed. Stories about shitcoins and scams aren’t just a branding problem — they’re a significant reality. Centralized companies, from Meta to whatever a16z is funding these days, see crypto as a means to create new forms of digital scarcity, commodify our relationships, extend their surveillance, cultivate profitable addictions, and claim the spoils for themselves.

Creating a better web (and a better future!) begins with building bridges with the world today: bringing together writers, engineers, historians, activists, policymakers, and scientists into the shared project of imagining, advocating for, and creating better human-technological futures.",http://joinreboot.org/,-1,-1,126,-1,-1,https://github.com/jaswsunny,1

When CryptoChicks first started in 2017, there was no incubation program that fit our project. Our startup was either too early in the stages of development or we weren’t knowledgeable enough to be part of the program. That’s where we decided to start CryptoChicks Hatchery: a pre-incubation startup program focused on women-led, blockchain startups (Although we welcome all). 

Our goal is to raise our startups off the ground by tackling the top reasons why most startups fail. This program follows a 4 milestone step process and helps each Founder reach them by offering...

Practical workshops and assignments
Personal mentorship from industry experts
Peer support of fellow founders 
Networking opportunities
Opportunities to win sponsor prizes and funding

By the end of the program, our startups will leave with the knowledge on how to build and grow their business successfully.

A SLP+CashSCript+Bitbox implementation that mimics a debt covenant as seen on the tv show 'Succession'. In the context of this contract, the loan is secured against a BCH holding as collateral. The debt is tokenised via SLP tokens and held by one or more creditors (SLP token holders). If the BCH USD price fell below the agreed floor price then creditors can trustlessly initiate the repayment process without the need for an intermediary nor actions from the debtor.

Trustless SLP Dividend Distribution
A CashScript / JavaScript implementation of a Simple Ledger Protocol distribution mechanism that trustlessly snapshots holders of a particular SLP token at any point in time and distributes BCH funds from a crowdfund wallet to the SLP holders.

>People can create their own synthetic media, ranging from memes to videos to full-fledged movies. This is our first community-made synthetic meme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiRi2_3MXFk

>People can finance their own content production in a novel way. Inspired by the PoolTogether model, Meme Pools lets people financially support their favourite creators and synthetic productions at no cost!

Email info@alethea.ai to get access to our Beta. Or wait for the public version scheduled for next week!
 
The funds raised will pay directly for Meme Pools sponsorships and computing costs.

*Meme Pools sponsorships allow synthetic meme creators to earn more from their pools.

My goal is to present data in a fun and interesting way that entertains cryptocurrency enthusiasts while simultaneously demonstrating the expansion of open and free markets powered by cryptocurrency, DeFi and Ethereum to newcomers.

While a passion project, creating these charts is both time-consuming, and requires paid subscriptions to data providers and video editing software. To date, I have personally covered these expenses.

A grant would allow me to expand these efforts to create high quality representations of DeFi and the most exciting areas of growth in the Ethereum ecosystem.

2985,endaomint-a-decentralised-nft-mentorship-and-gran,"ENDAOMINT

Welcome to ENDAOMINT - a Kernel-conceived idea, using the power of crypto and a DAO structure to challenge traditional modes of arts funding and grant making. I hope you will consider backing us, to help with development and outreach, working towards a soft-launch in mid 2022. The project is led by artist/photographer and writer, Rhiannon Adam, in conjunction with a number of crossover artists and IRL arts facilitators. 


Our name:

/ɪnˈdaʊm(ə)nt, ɛnˈdaʊm(ə)nt/
noun
DERIVED FROM:
 1.  'EN' – FROM LATIN. A prefix in a number of verbs meaning to include, to allow, or cause to happen, and, to hold within; to be a part of. 
 2. DAO – Decentralised Autonomous Organisation 
 3. MINT – i : to make (coins or money) out of metal 
 	             ii : create, produce 
                 iii : how an NFT becomes part of the blockchain

__

The catchy version: A self-perpetuating curated artist-led NFT space, sustained through cross-community collaboration, leveraging collective influence for successful arts fundraising. 

In a nutshell: a contributor-led DAO (creators and collectors), funding exciting NFT projects received via open-submission. Funding is raised through the sale of work by both well-respected on and off-chain creators, creating a culture of collaboration across worlds. Through a ""blind"" sales model, and hidden NFTs, artists are paid fairly, while contributing to the growth of the NFT ecosystem as a common goal. Different collector types are incentivised through the strength of the creator's profiles, lottery-type structure, and the chance to support new-work creation with minimal financial outlay:




ENDAOMINT is initially led by London-based artist and Kernel Block III fellow, Rhiannon Adam (Instagram), though governance will be led by the DAO. The initial ENDAOMINT cohort will be selected for its diversity, representing members from the queer, female, and BIPOC communities in order to ensure that as the DAO grows, it is representative of the fairer world that we would like to see more of in Web 3, rather than replicating the existing power structures of the bricks and mortar art world and the problematic funding mechanisms that it employs. 

--

The long read:

ENADOMINT believes:

Art is a public good
Artists should receive fair pay and a living wage
Artists should be able to access funding regardless of their race, gender, social status, or geography
Crypto art and 'traditional' art are equally valid
Collaboration across groups is necessary as the NFT space matures
Mentorship is key

Endaomint's mission is to empower creators through a risk-free ""blind"" sales model, with all artist-contributors rewarded equally, irrespective of past NFT sales history or profile. The pressure of individual selling is now shared, allowing artists to focus on what they do best – create. 

The aim: To onboard well-respected 'off-chain' collectors and artists, creating a high-quality growing support network for crypto-native artists, 'traditional' artists, and collectors alike, and through a DAO, to support high-quality NFT project creation through grant funding from the DAO treasury. By creating an engaged community with shared goals, it is our belief that ENDAOMINT can contribute to the cultural gravitas of the NFT – not just as items to be owned and traded, but where the NFT becomes a medium in its own right. 

Endaomint solves problems:

Off-chain ""traditional"" artists are often lost in the crypto space. Onboarding is tough, and the learning curve is steep. Crypto Twitter is a nightmare, existing platforms are free-for alls, and it is hard to experiment with every false-start or failed-sale logged on the blockchain. 

Crypto artists are often dismissed and left out of the ""traditional"" art conversation and find it hard to garner interest outside of cryoto-native communities. Crypto artists often find that it is hard to deviate from a successful style, and maintaining steady sales becomes as much of a focus as pushing the boundaries of their own work. 

By leveraging existing NFT collectors and 'art world legitimacy' – both groups will benefit. 

New collectors can experiment with purchasing NFTs with minimal financial outlay, while all collectors will have the opportunity to own exciting work, work that is already valued by each respective creative community. 

How it works:

BY SERIES: Each series of blind packs will consist of 15 different NFTs, by 15 artists (some traditional, some well-known in the crypto space), and released with varying rarity ratings. Each series may be organised around a theme, specific medium, or led by a guest curator. All NFTs will be minted on Polygon (to alleviate many environmental concerns), with data permanently stored on Arweave and IPFS. Within each series there will also be one lucky recipient who will be airdropped a 1/1 'wildcard' NFT. Each pack sale provides one entry to the draw. 

TIMED UNLOCK: There will be, for example, 750 packs released, with each one containing 4 NFTs, to add up to a total of 3000 NFTs. Think be@rbricks – though the pieces included in the ENDAOMINT's pack-series will remain hidden until the unlock day, and only participating artist names and profiles will be known ahead of time.   

REMAINING RANDOM: These NFTs blind packs will be randomly 'filled' with NFTs (randomising using Chainlink) and sent to the collector when unlocked (after all packs are sold, on a specified unlock date, so that each pack-owner has an equal chance of obtaining the rarest NFTs). A collector may receive a rare NFT by a well-known crypto artist alongside work by artists that they are unfamiliar with, or they may receive duplicate works, or, they may receive entirely unfamiliar work and discover 'new' artists. The key idea is that the selected artists will always be collated from across the 'traditional' artist VS 'crypto' divide, and artists will be free to create work in any medium that they see fit. 

TIMED RELEASES, STAGGERED PRICING: The packs will be released according to a struct timeframe – the earliest purchasers will receive the best pricing, incentivising early sales. By staggering pricing, there is also a window of time where new collectors can 'get in' on the action early, at an affordable and risk-free price point. E.g:

1st release - 50 packs  0.1 Ξ
2nd release - 100 packs 0.125 Ξ
3rd release - 150 packs 0.15 Ξ
4th release - 200 packs 0.2 Ξ
5th release 250 packs 0.25 Ξ

= 142.5 Ξ raised TOTAL for 750 packs sold

Resale on NFT packs set at 10% to be sent to the DAO. 

FAIR PAY: 50% of the proceeds go to the shared artist 'pot' – all artists will be paid equally, and If all packs sell, artists receive approx 4.75 Ξ for their contribution of just one piece to the series. Crypto-native artists who have an average sales tally equivalent to 4.75 ETH or higher will receive the highest rarity ratings, and participation in this project will not disadvantage them – they are NOT offering 'cut price' work. 

This mirrors 'real world' editioning, whhttps://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/ere large editions are cheaper, while small editions are more costly -  after all sales, proceeds are equal across the two sales models. This method acknowledges that the selected crypto native artists are already considered collectible in the space (reflected in their piece's rarity rating), and honours their need to maintain exclusivity, while also giving them a space to make work that  perhaps takes a new direction without the pressure of creating it for a specific target-buyer pool. 

For off-chain artists, the presence of the collectible crypto native artists will drive pack sales (collectors hoping to pick up a valuable work for a fraction of the cost), though in all likelihood it is these off-chain artists whose work is more likely to be discovered in the unlocked NFTs, therefore ""blasting"" their work to a new audience, and giving them a foothold in the NFT space from which to build. This is equivalent to a larger limited edition, the kind often used by artists to promote a book launch, charity print sale, or used to increase accessibility to collectors, alleviate risks, and engage new audiences. 

INCENTIVISED COMMUNITIES: The collective splits incentivise all artists to leverage their networks to sell, and lower prices encourage new collectors to engage – everyone is a winner. There is no need for artists to compete with one another and it is in everyone's best interest to have the packs sell.

__

At the heart of ENDAOMINT - is the DAO, where creators and collectors are encouraged to actively support community growth through a grant-making endowment – first you become a part of the project 'EN', then the 'DAO', whose existence helps artists to 'MINT' new work. 

Each NFT pack sold will have its sales fees split:

50% to artists – as noted above. 
40% to the ENDAOMINT DAO – an open-to-all artist grant funding mechanism managed by token holders (all contributors – artists, collectors, mentors – receive tokens to vote on grant applications).
10% to maintain ENDAOMINT infrastructure.

After unlock, a royalty structure will take over, where each ENDAOMINT NFT will be sold with 20% being retained by ENDAOMINT – 12% to the individual artist creator, 8% to the DAO. 

The DAO is  the beating heart of ENDAOMINT. The genesis group of artists will be selected to be diverse, to set the tone for future membership. Where collectors and artists alike help to build the community from the ground up, growing organically. All contributors to the project are invited to participate in governance, crafting the space they want to see.

The DAO The DAO welcomes grant applications from new artists, to push the boundaries of the NFT 'medium'. Grantees will automatically be invited to participate in a future ""pack"", creating circularity, adding value along the way, taking a project through from inception to collector. Special grants to target underrepresented groups may also be proposed.

The DAO will also govern future pack themes, new artist inclusion (DAO membership), guest curators, and will decide on hardship grants, event proposals, and carbon offset mechanisms. The DAO will become an ever-growing creative community.

__

Future implementations: 

Swap shop for NFT collectors wishing to collect the full series of NFTs, with the DAO and artist receiving shared swap fees. 
Mentorship scheme.
Redeemable section – collectors can 'burn' unlocked individual NFTs in exchange for real-world items.

I would like to introduce you my project that will let you send Ethereum to anyone with a valid email address with no pre registrations required at all.

TLDR; Find below the Instructions to test it

Moip Network has easy mechanics to make it work.
You want to send someone some Ethereum tokens but you don't have it's Ethereum Wallet address
You get it's email and go to moip.network 
Add it's email and the amount you want to send
Then add your email to receive a notification for yourself
Finally click send and wait for the transaction to happen
You will receive your emails with your details and the receive will get a beautifully constructed email with the Amount he received, What network etc. With his account details like Private key and Memo (Only first time)
Later when you send amount to same email it will go to same receiver address but no account details sent this time.

Demo (Testing) (Remember: Do not use Real Ethereum (money) to test it)
Visit stage website: https://blockchain-genievot.cloud.okteto.net/



That's centralized version of it but what about making it decentralized, Like a custodian smart contract where anyone can send to anybody with it's email and later receiver verify that email and withdraw his money.

That's what the plan with this grant. If you like to learn more how this can be done and How I am developing a similar use case with this. Then visit here:

TrueBlocks is a decentralized indexing solution for any EVM-based blockchain. Unlike other indexing tools, TrueBlocks works on a desktop enabling private, unfettered, and fast access to immutable data–no “recentralization” of chain data. 
 
TrueBlocks uniquely: 
 
Creates an address optimized index– “indexes every appearance of every address everywhere on the chain” 
Provides local-first queries enabling permissionless, trustless, filterable and fast access to an account’s on-chain history without the fear of third-party snooping,
Produces and distributes—for the public good—an “equitably” maintained and low-cost index using a “chunking method” that naturally distributes itself through content-addressable storage,
Retains the integrity of the data through the creation of a “reproducible” process called the Unchained Index,
Scales in a way natural to Web 3.0 by leveraging content-addressable storage to shard and cache received data.

802,metis-protocol-a-governance-and-collaboration-imp,"Painpoints to solve: DAO is a great idea and practice, so we hope to bring it to a much wider audience - internet communities (may not in the blockchain field), and then we found that it is still of high stake (wallet, tokens, systems or DApps development needed) for the general internet communities to launch a DAO. And for the internet communities, voting (which most DAOs' governance protocols are focusing on) is only a small fraction of all the use scenarios. Instead, they are more caring about how to buildup the collaborations with other trustless distributed collaborators and get things done, and how to protect the interest for all the collaborators. So, there is a big gap between the current DAO governance protocols and real needs.

Solutions: Metis Protocol hopes to bridge the gap via below mechanisms:
 
Metis Protocol builds on an optimistic assumption that every distributed collaborator will act professionally to deliver what they promised promptly, and with the promised quality. So, Metis Protocol defines the Meta Staking Contract(MSC),  which leverages staking as the foundation of governance (relationship establishing, disputes resolving, and collaboration terminating among these distributed collaborators). Their collaboration relationship is established and activated after they staked some kinds of tokens onto the MSC (just like deposit onto a 3rd party escrow account). The stakes will act as the commitment and will be returned(along with the incentives and reputation power) if everything goes well. However, if something goes wrong in the process, the hidden governance mechanism will be triggered, the MSC will be frozen, the off-chain Arbitrator will jump out to help, and the deposit of the “bad party” will be forfeited to repay the “good party”, the reputation power of the “bad party” will be downgraded as well. The 'presumption of innocence' principle of the Metis Protocol makes it worry-free for these unacquainted distributed collaborators to establish the collaboration conveniently.
 
Metis Protocol also designs the ComCo Management Framework, with which off-chain and digitalized tools will be used to implement the collaborations, and all the implementation has the track record on the blockchain to serve the governance mechanism. Collaboration management are placed onto the Optimistic Roll sidechain (high scalability, low cost, high privacy)to bridge the gap between off-chain value creation activities and on-chain governance. Distributed collaborators negotiate and confirm the collaboration details off the chain, then record the critical milestone information into the Transactions Statement Contract(TSC, deployed on the side chain) as the witness. The Framework also has the Microservice Tools Pool (MTP) to provide various microservice tools and APIs(wallet, wiki, chatroom, collaboration, compliance, etc.) for distributed collaborators to execute different business activities. The execution result of different stages will be stored as the track record and confirmed off the chain, and the updated state of the TSC will be synchronized to the main chain, which will trigger the MSC to allocate budget/incentives or call arbitration.
 
Metis Protocol synergizes the merits from the Staking Economy, Optimistic Rollup, Smart Contract, and Microservice Framework, and also is thinking from the perspectives of the user experience, which will help to foster a simplified, fair, protectable, practical, and high-privacy environment for the Ethereum ecosystem to govern and manage distributed collaborations. 
 
We hope to help the Ethereum ecosystem to cover more business scenarios. Operation teams(easy to launch a DAC and activate the community), distributed collaborators(worry-free environment to collaborate with others), and developers(ready-to-use APIs, templates, tools) in the Internet Communities, Blockchain Applications, Sharing Economy, Gig Economy, etc. will get benefit from our work.
 
Defi will also get benefit from the Metis Protocol. Community members can stake or invest in different collaborative projects based on the track record of the project and the team, and can pull back their investment if something went wrong. So Defi users can gain access to the project value (win-win for both sides), while not just staking some tokens to gain the interest.

We hope Metis Protocol could be one of the backbone layer 2 protocols of the Ethereum ecosystem and contribute for the public good to boost the explosive development of Web 3.

845,remote-developer-bootcamp,"We at BlockVigil were about to launch a mentoring program on-premise in India to assist in upskilling of students, fresh graduates and entry-level developers and transform into valuable assets for organizations in need of engineers who can execute cleanly.

…and CoViD-19 hit the world 😟

In light of the recent developments that have affected the economy and markets as a whole, we understand this is a time of uncertainties for such individuals.
This time presents us with a unique opportunity to execute the same plan remotely and reach out to a wider audience who will truly benefit from the program and they don't even need to be present in the city of Bangalore.

I decided to cover all costs associated with educational material and training efforts for those who need this the most after a review of their applications. The first cohort kicked off on April 1st, 2020 and we had 30 students attend from all over the world. 🌐

Here's a highlight video what was covered.

All participants get to attend 2 interactive sessions every week on Airmeet. None of the content is pre-recorded and is paced as per comfort of the cohort. Tasks at the end of each session allow them to immediate apply their learning and are mandatory to progress further making it competitive and different from typical courses online. They also get access to a private Slack group along with 1-on-1 mentoring from both Anomit and me.

Right as the 1st cohort ended, we tied up with EthGlobal for #HackMoney and three teams were support and mentored by us. We were aware that the hackathon may be harder for new developers but were amazed when one of the solo participants ended up winning Sia's $700 (in SC) bounty. 🎉

Three teams from the second Cohort participated in EthGlobal's #HackFS. BlockSig was a finalist and along with Team Azureus won bounties from Fleek. Couple more students have gone on to win bigger hackathons.

More details such as a full session video with code and tasks are on Github.

Cohort 3 just ended with more winners at EthOnline but we need the support from community to sustain and scale this. Apart from monetary help, spreading the word to deserving students would be equally welcome. We are also hoping to get experts such as Austin Griffith to do guest sessions. 🙏

For that reason, we've decided to create the Gitcoin Champions Program - a place for some of the longest-standing and most engaged folks we know in the community to help make sure we're keeping everything rolling.

Unfortunately, we don't yet live in a post-scarcity creator-collective economy, and so we need some extra help making sure all of the great people that are choosing to share their time with us are compensated. We'd like your support here, and even a few DAI helps.

We believe that reliable and transparent traceability is not only a PRIORITY but a RESPONSIBILITY to fight against fraud, corruption, and misappropriation of humanitarian aid goods, especially under the current pandemic crisis.  

VenezVit is solving the lack of accountability in the workflow of major actors in humanitarian aid distribution, more specifically for vital and life-saving medications. 

Our Ethreum based application allows NGOs, Associations, Pharmaceuticals, and Logistics companies, monitor goods during their journey. At the same time, we ensure that health-related aid gets to the intended beneficiaries. 

Your DAI contribution will help us complete the first pilot. We will manage the track and trace of donated medicines from top pharmaceuticals and follow their distribution through known NGOs. The pilot will show the power of technology to help eliminate waste, corruption and misuse of the life-saving medicines that are needed in countries in which access to medicine is limited. 

Lastly, We are looking for co-founders and like-minded people that join our cause, more specifically, a CTO that can help us pull this off.

1006,decentralized-flexible-organizations-rd-programma,"DFOs are an Ethereum-based Research & Development project. 
They are On-Chain companies with proprietary assets and voting tokens as programmable equities.  Made with ❤️ by Ethereans for Ethereans.

🔥 Microservices on Ethereum
This is a general-purpose protocol to deploy decentralized organizations. 
By employing their microservices-driven core, it ensures their Flexibility; by using voting tokens to govern them, it ensures their independence.

🏗 Lego Contracts
A new Flexibility Layer for Ethereum Dapps!
Microservices are a huge step forward in Web 2.0. Functions can easily be updated and fixed, without comprising an entire application. 
Through R&D, dApps can be coded with LEGO contracts—aka, upgradable microservices.

🧐 Why is Flexibility a fundamental R&D topic?
The monolithic method of coding Smart Contracts is a huge entry barrier for dApp developers. When Ethereans develop dApps, they have to buy costly—and timely—auditing services. However, sometimes not even this is enough.
​With a DFO as a base layer, Ethereans can develop every function step by step, which real users can then test and fix, without compromising the entire dApp.

🏗 Why Flexible?
Autonomous Organizations is a huge R&D to solve human coordination through fixed rules. Flexible Organizations is a different R&D to solve human coordination based on flexible and upgradable systems with unlimited powers aim to experiment different challenges by R&D sophisticated new governance structures and updates rather than fixed persistent rules.

🔮 Decentralized Flexible Organizations
The Decentralized Method of managing Flexibility
DFOs are designed to orchestrate the flexibility of LEGO contracts. 
Every single smart contract is added and governed by voting.
This even applies to core changes and rules of governance.

Resilient On-Chain Companies
as a base layer for Applications on top of Ethereum 

👾 Programmable Equities
Voting Tokens are the real Owner!
Decentralized Flexible Organizations have no owner. Voting tokens are the key! 
Voting tokens are like the real equity of the protocol and its assets.

👨‍💻 A General Purpose Protocol
Anyone can use DFOhub Smart Contracts to buidl their own version of it, with infinite kinds of business models, without need to reinvent the wheel.
We have already released an SDK—anyone can easily start coding it now!

👻 DFOhub, where Decentralized Flexible Organization begins

DFOhub is an On-Chain, decentralized Github to deploy and govern Decentralised Flexible Organisations.
It unlocks all functionalities required by communities to develop their own dApps, without needing to know and trust each other.

🏃‍♂️ Starting an On-Chain Company With Voting Tokens as Programmable Equities
DFOs are Flexible, On-Chain companies with proprietary assets and voting tokens as real programmable equities.
​Nobody has special permissions. DFOs have a microservices-driven design. 
Token hodlers add, edit and kill functionalities; manage community funds; and update rules of governance by smart contract-based proposals.

#2 Participate in our Github Repo: https://github.com/b-u-i-d-l

💎 Long-term Goal: Startups Without Founders

The most exciting thing is that DFO can open the doors to a new wave of Startups Without Founders! 

With DFOs a community of anonymous people can now start a project by deploying a DFO and building it piece by piece without needing to trust third parties or a well-known team of developers.

In fact, with DFO anyone can start a project and deploying an external Smart Contract to airdrop Voting Tokens every time an anonymous Developer will win a Survey to improve or BUIDL the Application.
